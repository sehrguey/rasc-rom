<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Solitary Barge Hauler<br>&nbsp;</h3>

    <p>
The suite was similar to the flophouse-styled doss rooms at Ukrainian railway stations, where you could spend a night if having the passport and one ruble on you. It's only that in the room at "Polar" the beds were more, about twenty pieces, for the most part laid already with the guests changed to their sportswear.
At that moment, my stomach reminded me of the omission to dine after the cultural life, and also of having no snack when in the pursue after a train model.
So I asked where a dining room or buffet was, and the relaxing sportsmen, kinda gloating, explained that anything of the sort was closed at seven.
I felt more and more hungry as well as the growing urge to punish my neighbors too happy to break the unwelcome news, so I take off my camel coat and whipped back down by the elevator.
</p><p>On the wide slab of a porch outside, alongside the hotel entrance, there also was a tall door to the restaurant which, naturally, was locked, yet well illuminated far inside where you could discern some kind of motion...
I started to pound onto the brown frame of the glazed  door. A man in a cap and yellow straps on his jacket sleeves appeared behind the glass.
At the sight of me in the jacket wide open on a white shirt, against the black-ink background of the night pricked by the weeny sparkles of downing flakes, he had no choice but to deduce that I was a guest, who had ventured out from the restaurant to powder my nose and stuff, in the open air.
He unlocked the door and I rushed past him into the hall.
</p><p>The restaurant occupied a pretty wide area, which allowed for celebration of two unrelated weddings at once, and there still remained vacant tables.
I had to wait for a long time, but at last a waiter approached me to whom I reveal my wish to have a square meal, plain,  without excesses.
To pass the time before he fetched my Spartan order, I watched the dance of the newlyweds from the nearby wedding. At the end of their kinda tango, the burly bride got bugged and dealt a mean elbow punch into the chest of the skinny groom.
He clutched his tie to keep  a painful gasp back, face cringed in a fake smile, where a few teeth were missing. The foundation of marital relations was being laid as early as the wedding party.
</p><p>Oh, boy! You've really stepped into... Sorry, that was a wrong card…
Aha! Here it is!.
"May the love and happiness you feel today shine through the years…"
</p><p>Paying for the meal I was one ruble short. Well, to be honest, I had a ruble, but I wanted to keep it for the next day's expenses. I asked the waiter's name to make up the shortfall later.
He gave his name and did not insist on getting the ruble immediately.
</p><p> Snugly filled, I got back to the room up there, and to the questions of the curious roommates  informed, with a yawn, that the restaurant below was still working…
</p><p>24 hours later, I arrived in Konotop and proudly brought the birthday present to At-Seven-Winds. Natasha's family already lived there in the nine-story block constructed by PMK-7.
The trip by the elevator to the fourth floor seemed provincially short, but their door was not opened to me.
Guena sometimes left for sessions at his technical institute by correspondence in the Donbas, and Natasha was, probably, visiting some of her block neighbors. I did not know a single one of them, although at times I visited the block because, in the way of helping the young family, I wrote all the test works on philosophy and history for Guena.
From the black sheep of a lousy brother-in-law, you still could sometimes get a fluff of wool…
</p><p>On my way to  Decemberists 13, I turned in one of the dead-ends on Pirogov Street, where stood Guena's parents' <em>khutta</em>. His father was asleep already, and Natalya Savelyevna sat in the living-room with Andrey – her grandson, aka my nephew.
I wanted to leave the box and go, but she asked me to assemble the toy railway, Andrey was still awake anyway.
When the train model started, with a low buzz, circling over the floor in the living room, I was not an uncle anymore, Andrey and I became equal in age…
</p><p>The recovery of the translations lost on a local train in the frenzy of drunken akinesia, took about a year. Because they still were fresh in my memory I couldn’t  extend the pleasure for a longer period.
After the final full-stop in the last translated story, I took the four-volume collection to Nezhin, to return it to Nona.
</p><p>Nearing the teachers' block in the Count's Park, I caught up with Nona and Lidya Panova, who was my group's curator in the years of my study at the English Department of the NGPI.
They were heading to the staircase-entrance in their section, but noticed me and stopped to wait.
I greeted the ladies and informed Nona how impossible it was to convey with mere words all the gratitude I felt for the four-volume originals, borrowed from her and now brought back, here you are.
</p><p>She smiled from under her glasses and reached out for the cellophane bag.
I intercepted her hand, like, for a democratic handshake in the style of characters by Jack London. But instead, unexpectedly even for myself, I gallantly stooped to kiss the back of her hand. Only after that, the bag was passed.
Regaining the upright posture, I gave Panova a stiff nod and left...
Well, at least I hadn't clicked the shoe heels like hussar Lieutenant Rzhevsky, the f-f..er..I mean, flamboyant hero of the f-f..er..folklore jokes.
</p><p>My euphoria got off the local train at the first stop after Nezhin and grim misgivings turned my fellow-travelers.
What a blessing, after all, is the inability to make up detailed plans!
Them those plans should be kept as short as possible: Prepare a collection of translated short stories for publishing in 150 000 copies. Period.
</p><p>When thinking the plan out in all the minor details, you expose your whole undertaking to a deadly risk.
There inevitably will pop up some insurmountable detail and send your plan to RIP, the way  Titanic was tranquilized by its iceberg.
Look out! What the f...!!!!!
</p><p>Bang!. Krchbrdzzz!.
 And then there comes the muffled, mind-pacifying, sound of sedate bubbling...what's the use of anything...why to strive for the impossible...ible...ble…
</p><p>Now, what normal publishing house will ever look through  my scribble-scrabble scrawling?.
But, is there a way to transform them into typewritten text? Maybe, learning to type by myself?
A yummy plan! D'you know a place where they sell typewriters?.
(...and another iceberg penetrates the hold....)
</p><p>The secretary of Manager of SMP-615 had a juggernaut of "Yatran" typewriter on her desk. Sort of a shop floor machine tool with a black cord to feed it with 220 voltage.
You simply touched a key and it responded with series of uncontrollable bursts, in the style of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, nothing like the lasciviously seductive cluck-cluck-cluck of typewriters in the movies.
Besides, the secretary did not know Ukrainian, and even Russian texts she typed with one finger.
</p><p>...well, suppose, after work, I would come to the office and little by little...
</p><p>Yes, this one also went straight to the sea bottom, because the new boss of SMP-615 was so jealous.
He viewed the SMP-615 administrative building as kinda personal warren or, say, chicken coop, and would not tolerate any bricklayer horsing around even after work.
The icebergs of unforeseen details threatened the plan from all sides and brought the navigation to a halt…
</p><p>We worked in the locomotive depot at the construction of the three-story administrative building, when my sister Natasha, at a chance meeting on a streetcar, shared that Eera, by the by, was going to get married in Nezhin.
Doubts in any information from my sister were senseless, you simply had to  take it for granted...
The news in passing way of crushed me for more than a day.
</p><p>Yet, I recovered, thanks to our foreman Mykola Khizhnyak's suggestion that I dismantle the trestles alongside the finished partition on the second floor.
When the laid partition gets as tall as 1.2 meters, you have to install the cradles by it, bridge them with timber and continue laying bricks from that trestle, up to the ceiling.
The cradles brought from the SMP-615 base were too few for all the team, and we were substituting them with <em>ratsookha</em>  (that is how our team streamlined the word "rationalization).
</p><p><em>Ratsookha </em>was a series of pallets stitched with nails in twos with each pair working as a cradle.
Because the pallets were shorter than needed, on top of the first decking we added further<em> ratsookha </em>to be bridged with boards forming the next level deck. The whole contraption looked like a house of cards, was more flimsy and shaky than the legitimate trestles, but it worked.
The trickiest moment came with dismantling<em> ratsookha</em> trestles. Some of the boards in decking were nailed to the pallets, others not, and they all were high above your head so, when you started to knock them off and down to the floor, the scattered fragments of crushed bricks and layers of mortar spilled and dried over the planks up there were pouring down as well.
Few people on our team liked dismantling trestles. And for me, it was, sort of, a chess nut to crack. Only the falling fragments should be dodged in time...
However, for that particular dismantling, I sent all chess to hell.
</p><p>Furious, like a berserk Viking running to battle in just a flax linen tank top shirt, with a long iron breaker I pulled the boards away from the nails screeching and squealing in protest.
When the top deck collapsed on the floor I, in frenzied swaying over the mess of boards under my feet, continued slashing and slitting the cradles of the stitched pallets with the sweeping blows of  enraged breaker, while roaring like a wounded beast: "A wedding?! Here's a wedding for you!."
My nostrils rounded, and sprawled in passion,  pumping, in and out, the dust from the thick cloud whipped up by  toppling crashing trestles.
</p><p>It does feel good to ravish in ecstasy of cutting all the tethers, getting loose and letting yourself go, at least sometimes… However, not everyone is vouchsafed the pleasure. Me neither. Because even while raging in the unruly demolition of what was there to destroy, I still was fully aware that all that was a mere aping of Odysseus’ action in a recent movie adaptation of his wanderings.
He similarly pulled his lips over the clenched teeth, when on his return home he started  knocking off, one by one, the suitors to his wife Penelope. As for the wedding which "here's for you!", that also was a quotation from the same flicks.
</p><p>Anyway, just in a few minutes in place of the trestle, there was a heap of boards interspersed with torn up pallets.
The cloud of dust hung in the air over the battle field and, in the corridor, the foreman's wife, rigger Katerina, standing still near the doorway, listened intently – what wedding was I about?.
</p><p>My sister Natasha never reported on Eera's new marriage.
Seems like the flash-team of Odysseus and me did a shamefully good job at derailing quite a natural course of events in the life of an innocent, unfamiliar, female, whose only error was being same-named and living at the place once dwelt by my Eera.
Just another folly of mine...
</p><div id="span"><p>(...as it turned out, I was neither a wolf nor a hooey-pricker, but an ornery dog in the manger.
Like those kings that sent their divorced wives under the home arrest in a monastery.
Yet, if the monastery has a proper gardener with a good lever, as depicted by Boccaccio...
</p><p>Oops, I am again at it, this time carried away inventing rationales  for royals as if I don't have problems of my own...)</p></div>
