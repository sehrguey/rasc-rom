<img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
     <p>
Yes, I was sitting on the wide concrete two-step porch of the two-story administrative building.
</p><p>Yes, it was a strike, because at ten in the morning, instead of chinking my trowel against the bricks, I changed clothes in our team trailer amid At-Seven-Winds and showed up at the base of SMP-615.
</p><p>Yes, it was a sit-in strike and, so as to be seated with more comfort, I took a wooden chair from the check-entrance house at the gate and dragged it onto the porch of the administrative building.
</p><p>It was a classic summer day, in the blue sky a huge puffy mass of a solitary, brightly white, cumulus hung anchored over the production building, sending no shade to the vast sun-smitten yard.
The gray fence of concrete panels couldn’t hide the tall railway embankment, along which express trains flew with hasty knock-knocking past the mortar unit, giving way to solidly pounding cars of endless freight trains getting on in both directions.
</p><p>It was a casual busy day, and only I did nothing but sweating in that blue shirt of acetate silk which is the same crap as nylon, just a little softer.
</p><p>I was sitting a little bit aside from the entrance, so as not to accidentally obstruct the way to rarely passing employees of SMP-615.
</p><p>Two locksmiths, the husbands of Lydda and Vitta from our team, stopped by to ask why I was here and not at work.
Without a word of explanations, I pointed with my thumb at the board for pointers in labor performance  of glossy brown linoleum, placed on the same porch, but on the other side from the entrance.
And the chief mechanic guessed himself to read it carefully…
</p><p> The pointers board, normally, was hung for life in the lobby on the first floor, next to the shut up window out of which once a month we received our payment. And year after year, the board chastely guarded the intact virginity of its linoleum, although a piece of chalk was put on the lower plank in its frame...
That day the board's star hour pealed and out it went and stood there covered with the pompous handwriting from which, without any graphology, anyone could right away see a graphomanic:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">Our trade-union boss is a liar!<br>
Down with Slaushevsky!
</p><p>I knew, if that had happened somewhere in England, the younger representatives from both factions of the Labor Party would have already been portraited standing next to the board, and the reporters of that same<em> Morning Star </em> would have already interviewed me: what's caused so a militant intolerance towards the trade-union leader?
Until that morning, I also had only sympathy for him.
</p><p>The foreman of carpenters, Anatoly Slaushevsky, had a pleasant countenance below the milky gray hair on his head. In Hollywood, he would  have easily made a career in the line of a noble sheriff in various Westerns. But we too kept noble looks in high esteem, and Slaushevsky was year after year elected the chairman of the trade-union committee of SMP-615.
It was a no-charge position, so he also lived on just his monthly payment. Like everyone else.
And he thought that I would understand him, like everyone else, when he told me on the site that morning, "No go."
</p><p>"How's that 'no go'?"
</p><p>"Just so that no go."
</p><p>Never, in the most horrible nightmares, ever dreamed he of being accosted with the unknown, yet obviously defamatory name of "boss"—white on brown—accompanied by aggravating demand to put him in an unusual position.
</p><p>Sympathy is a short-living thing.
A month before I would readily give him a hug when he told me there was a permit to the Artek pioneer camp.
</p><p>Yes, I wanted it, sure thing! All my pioneer childhood I dreamed of visiting the sunny Artek on the Crimean coast.
Now I, naturally, did not fit there by my age anymore, but Lenochka would be happy to see the Black Sea...
</p><p>In fact, Lenochka got a little scared and began to ask her grandmother, who responded that Artek was very good.
And Lenochka had already passed all the doctors from the children polyclinic with their medical checks. She even made her choice which suitcase she would take with her for keeping her things in Artek.
</p><p>"No go."
</p><p>A month before Slaushevsky did not yet know that someone else would guess that Artek was good. That's why he offered to me that free permit paid for by the trade-union.
And it did not matter that the smart late-comer, to whom some manager from SMP-615 boasted about having such a permit, was from another organization. Anyway, his position in his organization was higher than that of a bricklayer.
</p><p>"No go."
</p><p>If you live on just your monthly payment, you must think rationally. As everyone else.
Grunt, scratch in the back of your neck, say "fuck!", and go back to your workplace.
What's the use of showing your horns to Slaushevsky? He's also like everyone else…
</p><p>I knew exactly how all that would evolve in England, but I had no idea what would happen next here, in my native land.
So, my role was that of an on-looker in acetate silks, only I had to unfasten a couple of buttons, the day was too darn hot...
</p><p>Round the white-brick corner of the administrative building slowly floated a white Volga.
It made a loose turnabout over the fine dust in the road surface and pulled up in front of the porch with its nose to where it had come from.
The driver got out, leaving two passengers in the back seat, climbed the porch, read the two lines on the linoleum of the monthly pointers of labor performance board and, without ever looking at me, entered the building.
He soon returned, got back into the car and his two burly passengers came out of it and approached me.
</p><p>"Let's go."
</p><p>"Where?"
</p><p>"You'll see."
</p><p>It's inconvenient to talk turning your face up in two directions.
I got up and put my hand on the back of the chair, "Okay, I'll just take the chair back."
</p><p>"They'll take it without you."
</p><p>And the two of them instantly gripped my biceps – each one from his side with both hands.
Gently and slowly they led me towards the Volga.
</p><p>At a distance, the monitor group of two locksmiths and one welder stood watching from the shade in the doorway to the production building, a lost and found preparatory sketch by Repin for his famous "The Arrest of a Propagandist".
</p><p>The archangel on the left, responding to my meek compliance, loosened his grip a little. He already, like, just strolled along comradely embracing my arm with his palms.
</p><p>I shouted to the driver, "The one on my left is shirking!" The grips from both sides immediately hardened and soon the three of us were sitting in the back seat, with me in the center. Like, a f-f..er..I mean, festive king on the coronation day.
</p><p>While Svaytsikha was opening the gate–the first and last time that I saw it locked–I shouted to her to take back from the porch the chair I had borrowed from her workplace.
And the Volga drove to Konotop.
</p><p>After some other gate, they told me to get over into a small UAZ van with no windows in the back. One of the burly guys got in with me, the vehicle revved ahead but soon we stopped again.
Through the opening to the driver cab and the following windshield, there were seen the poplars nearby the City Medical Center.
</p><p>After a prolonged wait, the back door swung open. On the sidewalk stood the psychiatrist Tarasenko.
"Yes, it's him."
After those his words, the door slammed shut again and I was taken to Romny. Without any voluntariness on my part…
</p><p>Your looks depend on how favorable is the disposition of the mirror you are looking in.
I noticed it more than once. In some mirror – wow! I'm really gorgeous! While in another – is that ghoul I?
</p><p>The most in-love-with-me mirror I had ever met, was the pier-glass in the hall of the fifth unit of the regional psychiatric hospital in the city of Romny.
It showed me what a terrific handsome man I was, after all. And without any cinematic sweetness – just a comely man and that's it.
</p><p>In those three months in Odessa, I looked like Konkin, or he was made up to look like me when starring in "No way to change the meeting point".
And it did not matter much, who's like who, the main thing that there, from the pier-glass, at me was looking a man of unusual, for the stereotyped standards, handsomeness by the Titian's brush.
The red pajamas in pin-thin yellow stripes, brown soft hair slightly lightened by their sunburn, but the main advantage was the color of the eyes. Some singular, inimitable, color – that of melting honey.
</p><p>And let Captain Pissak, composing my verbal portrait in front of the ranks of the first company, say, "Look at his eyes! They are lynx eyes!"
But no, Captain, the pier-glass would not lie – they were good!
</p><p>The only pity was that no one saw it except me. The hall was empty, and the corridor was quiet.
A dozen patients stayed in the observation wardroom and all the rest of the fifth unit for the entire daylight hours were kept–with the break for a midday meal–in the Area.
</p><p>It's summer, after all!.</p>
