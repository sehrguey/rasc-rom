<p>
Now, everything that keeps me on Twoic's leash boils down to the needs of my stomach, and that of the reproductive organ and... and is that all?.
We need something else here, thinking in only two dimensions seems not enough for a Hegelian...
Where is the third?! Spit it out!. A-aha! Here it is – the brain!
The brain with its lofty needs and, first of all, to pour out the crap crammed into it, to ease the tension in the storage cells so as not to burst sending its gray matter in every thinkable direction.
Ain’t it a torture – be full of pearls but having no one to spill the goods in front of?
</p><div id="span"><p>(...who would decline the role of  Mentor?
Feeding the pearls of wisdom into the oral orifice of a naively gaping youth...)
</p></div><p>Twoic presented me with that opportunity also, by his questions.
How to choose the right trail in the jungle of a research institute laboratory squabbles, where each spider  for himself in the common jar, one for all?
Who's more useful for your scientific career – a talented but alcoholic micro-chief, aka the manager of the laboratory, or as dull as a felt boot macro-chief in charge of the institute department? Who of the two to serve to?
</p><p>Answering these and similar questions, I was amazed by the extensive stockpile of reprobate Machiavellianism within me. I wouldn't ever dream of having so vast resources, communication with Twoic brought into light the cached arsenal.
</p><p>However, the essence of my maxims was so plain that Twoic sensed all of that himself and instinctively conformed to even before my broadcasting.
It's only he couldn't put it to words, that we get landed into this world where everything is occupied already – "the house's sold out!" – which situation calls for snatching a place under the sun for our dearest selves, and the end justifies the means, so…
And Twoic was all too happy to agree.
But what about me? Do I live by this sermon? Do I follow it,  eat it out?
</p><div id="span"><p>(...following your own theories is not the must though.
Nietzsche, the inventor of  superman in the form of a "blond beast", was himself a physically miserable nuisance.
</p><p>"Snap a place under the sun for yourself," proclaimed I, that's true.
However, as for me, I'd sooner drift away in search for the sun attainable in a more hominine way, avoiding their scrimmage...)
</p></div><p>Well, now, are you happy with your self-psychoanalyzing? Got all the nooks turned inside out? Don't be shy, we are alone – Twoic's too busy with dialing and checking his pocket notebook.
So, is that it? The orgies for your stomach plus hopes for getting a second-hand whore, and tickling your vanity by spilling intellectual pearls? Is it the full list of reasons why I'm with him?
</p><p>Well, that's why, definitely, yes...
And also because of the feeling of freedom, when I break loose from the routine of my ordered, polished, clockwork way of life with the bath-going on Thursdays, washing on Mondays, ironing on Tuesdays, with the beach or reading room on weekends and the ever-present feeling of emptiness and privation, and the neverending alertness…
</p><p>Wow! I see, now you flashed  your love for freedom too, well done! And now, hopefully,  that's all?
</p><p>Of course, yes, is not all that enough for a friendship?
</p><p>Don't try to cheat the dialectics. You omitted the opposite force – hatred.
</p><p>And why should I hate him? He feeds me, provides drinking, presents an outlet to escape...
</p><p>Seems like, in your enumeration, you bashfully omitted the opportunity to practice masochism, eh? What is a pleasure if not some sweet pain?
</p><p>...had he slept with her or not?.. everything in me contracts into a tight tangle of scorching hot pain  and  slowly dissolves in mute squeals: no, it cannot be.. but if?. and the pangs grip anew  to be followed by numb warmth spilling over the innards: no, no...
</p><p>At one of my first visits to the Twoic's village, on a late windy night, we were sitting at a bus stop by the empty wide square. The whitewashed walls of the stop, as well as the planks of the benches, were stamped with inscriptions and cuts of all kinds of Deep Purples, Dynamos, Svetas, Blitzes, Vovas, and lots of dates...
All of a sudden, Twoic spoke of Eera, "She said she had never had better sex than with you."
</p><p>That compliment, sort of, scalped me. They do not come up with such confessions at the table in a café. For such a subject, you should lie together in one bed after having a sex.
Did she count on Twoic someday would deliver these words to me and I recreate the whole picture? Or was it out of females' feline inclination to scratch their fucker? That's why he reached then out for a cigarette of Belomor-Canal...
</p><p>...don't succumb to complexes, Twoic, I've never been a sex prodigy... and now I know why he found me in Konotop... and I am sorry for the helpless babble about blessing drops... he came then with much more trivial agenda – to urinate over the ashes of Hooey-Pricker and stop feeling envious even post-mortem...
</p><p>He somehow felt that he had blurted out a bit too much and, to efface it, started swearing that he had never in his life had anything with Eera...
As if I asked him whether it was so.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...if you pretend to be a stupid ass for too long then, at times, you become it...)
</p></div><p>"Have you ever beat her?" he asked a little later.
</p><p>Oops, so she shared about that slap too.
</p><p>"I hit just once, at the final date," reported I, "but it was a light spank, solely for the compliance with protocol."
</p><p>Twoic laughed his endemic laughter…
</p><p>The next morning, we went for a swim in <em>kopanka.</em>
I did not feel like entering the water, so I just walked around the pond and lay on the beach.
</p><p>Twoic swam it from end to end.
His blue eyes radiated a melting glow of satisfaction when he came ashore nearby me with water trickles dripping from his trunks.
</p><p>"This look was in his eyes when getting off her," thought I.
The thought brought pain and even though not so acute as I expected, yet more replete than I would like…
</p><p>She approached me on the beach and started a talk about the <em>Morning Star </em> dropped on the sand next to the pink coverlet on which I was sitting. If I really read   or it was it just a trick to lure girls. What that big article was about, for example.
</p><p>So, I had to retell for the examiner what happened to a 19-year-old youth, a member of the family of smugglers. They regularly flew from Pakistan to England, swallowing a heap of small tight packages before the flight. Stomach served an ideal repository, the specially trained controller dogs at airports couldn’t sniff out any drugs.
Upon arrival at a safe house in London, the whole family underwent the stomach lavage and—rah-rah-rah!—congrats on the successful shipping.
</p><p>The fizzle happened on the flight when one of the small packages burst in the stomach of the young man. They used to tamp too much into one package and, on the arrival, the guy was taken from the aircraft straight to the hospital with a severe overdose.
They washed the drugs out of his stomach and saved his life. And that was the end of the family business.
Some sad, in general, story…
</p><p>She sympathized and shared that she was also a nurse...
Basically, a good profession for a girl about thirty, who did not look a movie star, yet everything else was in place. My trunks could witness for the fact because, when finishing the story, I had to pull my knees up to my chin to look like a civilized gentleman and not a heated gorilla in the zoo.
</p><p>Then everything went on like in a fairy tale, she told me her address in At-Seven-Winds, and we agreed on my coming to her place on Tuesday with a visit of friendship and reciprocal understanding.
She strolled away along the sandy beach, and I had to stretch out on my stomach, so as not to attract the public attention with my swimming trunks stuck out in anticipation of the day after tomorrow.
</p><p>That day came at last and, after work, I rode from the station square to the city center.
In "The Flowers" shop there happened nothing to my liking and I had to buy a kinda crossbred of daisies and sunflower.
</p><p>There still remained a hell of a lot of time before the appointed hour, so I took a walk back to the station and then along Club Street to At-Seven-Winds.
In Zelenchuk Area, Vladimir Gavkalov, the truck crane operator from SMP-615, who looked like Eera's brother Igor, crossed my path.
</p><p>"Sehryoga!" yelled he on the run, "You've lost your way! The bathhouse’s in the counter direction!"
</p><p>I did not like that whisker of a bouquet myself but valiantly  carried it on.</p>
