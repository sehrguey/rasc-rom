<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>Football was played in the grassy field between the Bugorok-Knoll and the garbage bins enclosure.
  Team captains nomination was based on their supremacy in age, height and the volume of shrill cries they issued in a debate.
</p><p>Then the boys, in pairs, went aside and put heads together, “You’re ‘hammer’ and I’m ‘tiger’, okay?”
</p><p>“No! No! I’m ‘rocket’, you’re ‘tiger’.”
</p><p>Having agreed on the placeholder handles, they returned to the captains-to-be and asked the one whose turn it was to choose, “Which one for your team: ‘Rocket’ or ‘Tiger’?”
</p><p>With the human resources divided, the game began. How I wanted to be a captain! To be so popular that all the boys would hanker to play in my team!
But the dream remained just a dream…
</p><p>I zealously scrambled through the grass: from one football goal to the other. I was desperate to win and didn’t spare myself, ready to do anything for our victory. It’s only that I never could get near the ball. At times it rolled towards me, yet before I got prepared to kick it properly, the swarm of “ours” and “theirs” came racing around and send it far afield.
</p><p>And again I plodded in a clumsy trot, back and forth, and shrieked, “Pass! Me here!” but no one listened to me and everyone else screamed too and  was also running after the ball, and the game rolled on without my actual participation…
</p><p>In summer all our family, except Grandma Martha, went to Konotop in the Sumy region of Ukraine, to the wedding of Mom’s sister Lyudmila and the region champion of weightlifting in the third weight class, young, but rapidly balding, Anatoly Arkhipenko from the city of Sumy.
</p><p>A truck with a canvas top took us through Checkpoint – the white gate in the barbed-wire fence surrounding the whole Zona, to the Valdai railway station where we boarded a local train to the Bologoye station to change trains there.
</p><p>The car was empty with no one but us on the wooden yellow benches paired back-to-back on both sides of the aisle between the green walls.
I liked the car swaying in time with the clatter of wheels on rail joints beneath the floor. And I liked to watch out of the big window the dark log posts that popped up to flick across the windowpane and the endless stream of wires which they carried on their crossbars went sagging down then up before the leap-flick of the next post and the unrolling stream slid into the next sag and went up, and again, and again, and...
</p><p>At the stops, the local train patiently waited giving way to more important trains until they’d hurriedly whoosh by.
</p><p>One especially long wait happened at the station of Dno whose name I read in the glazed sign on the green plank-wall of its shed. And only after a solitary steam engine puff-puffed past the shed, slowly piercing with its long black body the  white curls of its own steam, our train moved on.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…I recollected that station and the black glitter of the engine that crawled through the milky mist of the steam when I read that at the station of Dno, Colonel of the Russian Army Nikolay Romanov signed his renunciation of the royal throne.
</p><p>However, by that act, he didn’t save himself, nor his wife, nor the children of their royal family all lined along the basement wall and shot at and then those not killed with the volley were finished off with the rifle bayonets.
</p><p>I knew nothing of all that sitting there in the local train by the shabby shed. Neither was I aware that it does not matter if I knew it or not.
  One way or the other, all that is part of me. It’s me…
</p><p>Anyway, it’s good that we don’t know all in childhood…)
</p></div><p>Most of the houses along Nezhin Street in the city of Konotop kept slightly off the road, standing behind their respective fences which reflected the owner’s level of prosperity, as well as the main trends and stages in the evolution of the local fencing technologies.
</p><p>However, the left-side line of sundry fencing stretches in the street was briefly interrupted with the wall of Number 19 whitewashed ages ago, having two windows in thoroughly bleached paint-coat and four wooden shutters to seal the windows off for the night.
</p><p>To enter the house, one should have passed through the wicket of tall weather-worn planks, side by side with the wider, yet constantly closed gate which separated the yard from the street. The comer should also know which of the  four entrances they needed. The doors were identically distributed between two windowless verandas abutting the house in between the four windows looking in the yard.
</p><p>The veranda next to the wicket, with both of its doors, as well as the half of the whole house, belonged then to Ignat Pilluta and his wife Pillutikha, therefore the pair of windows overlooking Nezhin Street were theirs. The plank walls of the second veranda wore a coat of rambling vine with wide green leaves and pale clusters of dinky, never ripening, berries; the blind partition, also of planks, divided the second veranda’s inside into two lengthwise sections for the two remaining owners.
</p><p>The home, aka <em>khutta</em>, of our grandmother, Katerina Ivanovna, comprised the half-dark veranda-hallway, the kitchen that had a window viewing the two stairs beneath the outside entrance door and the brick stove in the opposite corner next to which stood the leaf of the constantly open door to the only room in the <em>khutta</em>.
</p><p>The space between the whitewashed walls there was filled with the perpetual limbo-like dusk seeping in through the room's window from the solid shade under the giant elm in the two-meter wide backyard, who also shadowed half of the neighboring yard of the Turkovs at Number 17.
</p><p>Turning round the far corner in the second veranda, you reached the last, fourth, door belonging to the <em>khutta</em></em> of the old man Duzenko and his wife.
 </p><p>They also had the same-sized sequence of hallway-kitchen-room,  yet with two windows more than in Grandma Katya’s <em>khutta</em> because of the symmetry in layout – the two windows looking to the street called for two windows looking into the common yard.
</p><p>Two mighty American Maples with pointed tips in their open-palm leaves grew in the yard right next to each of the Duzenko's additional window. The space between the maples was filled with a squat stack of red bricks, brittle with their age, which old man Duzenko all his life kept for a possible reconstruction of his <em>khutta</em></em> in the future.
</p><p>About six meters away from the breastwork between the maples and parallel to it, there stretched a long shed of ancient grayish boards, whose blind wall had blind doors with large padlocks. Their respective owners kept there the fuel for the winter, and in an enclosure within Grandma Katya’s fuel section lived a pig named Masha.
</p><p>Opposite the veranda coated with barren vine, one more huge elm and a plank-fence separated the common yard from the neighbors at Number 21. Next to the elm, there stood a small shed plastered with the mixture of clay, cow dung, and chopped straw, that also was padlocked to secure the earth-cellar of the Pillutas inside it.
</p><p>The Duzenkos’ earth-cellar shed of bare boards stood farther away from the street and as if continued the long common shed, being separated from it by the passage to the kitchen gardens.
</p><p>Between those two earth-cellar sheds, there stood a small lean-to structure covering the lid over Grandma Katya’s earth-cellar – a vertical shaft two-meter deep, with a wooden ladder going down, into the dark between the narrow walls of earth. At the bottom, the flashlight disclosed four cavelike niches cut to all four sides and slightly deeper than the shaft bottom. That’s where they stored potatoes and carrots for the winter, and beets too because the frost couldn’t reach the stored vegetables at such depth.
</p><p>In the corner formed by the Duzenko’s and Grandma Katya’s earth-cellar sheds, there stood a kennel with the black-and-white dog Zhoolka chained to his house. He tinkled the chain and whiplashed it against the ground, barking furiously at any stranger who entered the yard. But I made friends with him on the very first night when, by Mom’s prompt, I took out and dumped into his iron plate the leftovers after supper…
</p><p>Grandma Katya’s hair was quite gray and a little wavy. She had it cut to the middle of her neck and held in place with a curved plastic comb beneath the back of her head. The pure white of the hair contrasted to the swarthy skin of her face with a thin nose and somewhat rounded, as if frightened, eyes.
</p><p>And in the somber room behind the kitchen, on one of the three blind walls, there hung a photographic portrait of a black-haired woman with an aristocratically high hairdo and a necktie (as was the fashion once upon the New Economic Policy times during the late twenties) – Grandma Katya in her young years.
</p><p>Next to her, there was an equally large photo of a man with a heavy Jack London’s chin, wearing a Russian collar shirt and black jacket; that was her husband Joseph when in the position of the regional trade auditor before his arrest and exile to the North, and abrupt disappearance strangely coinciding with the retreat of Germans from Konotop…
</p><p>On the whole, I liked the visit to Grandma Katya, although there were neither<em> gorodki</em> nor football playing, and only daily Hide-and-seek with the children from the neighboring <em>khutta</em>s</em> who would never find you if you hid in Zhoolka’s kennel.
</p><p>Late in the evening, on the log electric-line pillars along the street, there lit up rare yellow lamps, unable to disperse the night dark even on the ground beneath themselves. May beetles flew with a bomber buzz above the soft black dust of the road, yet so low that you could knock them down with your jacket or a leafy branch broken off a cherry tree hanging from behind someone’s fence. The captives were incarcerated in empty matchboxes whose walls they scratched from inside with their long awkward legs. The following day, we opened their cells to admire the fan-like mustaches and the chestnut color of their glossy backs. We tried to feed them with shredded grass blades, but they did not seem hungry and we set them free from our palms the same way as you set a ladybug to fly.
</p><p> The beetle ticklishly crawled to a raised fingertip, tossed up its rigid forewings to straighten out their long transparent wings packed under that protective case, and flew off with low buzzing. Okay, fly wherever you want – in the evening we’ll catch more…
</p><p>One day from the far end of the street, there came a jumble of jarring wails affirmed by rare prolonged booms. The sounds of familiar cacophony made the people of Nezhin Street went out of their yards and, standing by their gates, inform each other whose funeral it was.
</p><p>In front of the procession, three men were marching slowly with their lips pressed to the brass pipes of trumpets sobbing woefully. The fourth one carried a drum in front of him like a huge potbelly. After walking for as long as it was proper, he smote its side with a felted stick. The wide belt cinching the drum across the drummer’s back left both his hands free to hold the felted stick in one of them and a wide copper plate in the other, which he from time to time crashed against the second such plate screwed upon the drum rim, to which event the trumpets responded with a new splash of disparate wailing.
</p><p>After the musicians, they carried a large photo of a sullen man’s face and several wreaths with white-lettered inscriptions over black ribbons. A medium platform truck followed the wreaths, purring its engine. On the platform with the unfastened sides, there stood an openwork monument of rebar rods coated with silver paint. Two men grabbed onto the rods from both sides to keep their balance over the open coffin at their feet with the deceased laid on display.
 </p><p>A small nondescript crowd closed the slow procession.
</p><p>I did not dare to go out into the street, although Mom and Aunt Lyudmila were there standing at the gate as well as the neighbors with their children by the wickets of their <em>khutta</em>s</em>.
</p><p>Yet, driven by curiosity, I still climbed the gate from inside to peek over it. The lead-colored nose stuck from the pallid dead face looked so horrible that I fled back to the kennel of black-and-white Zhoolka, who also was ill at ease and whining to back up the trumpets…</p>
