<img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
  <p>
Everything became as  before, or nearly so...
Construction sites in Konotop, weekends in Nezhin...
The eyelids came back to their normal level canceling the need to strain the eye muscles...
The translations. The poems…
</p><p>Those poems started to pop up after the start of my bricklayer career at SMP-615.
They were not poems at first, just unattached pieces of irrelevant phrases. Some seemed attractive with the alternating play of sounds within them, others because of inherent ambiguity, or rather being double-barreled so that they could be interpreted in different ways.
</p><p>While busy with the production process, I, invisibly for my fellow-bricklayers, turned and twirled those pieces in my mind, slit-split them then re-assembled anew, then threw them out of my head to dogs, to devils, to scrap fucks, but the most persistent ones came back after the bum’s rush, and French walk, and flying a kite (consecutively) to stay cheekily there as if they never were away, not for a sec's sliver.
Then there remained the only resort – to stick them with a pen down to a piece of paper and forget.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...in six years there gathered about 30 pieces of those unsolicited self-willed buggers in two languages, because each one was coming the way it fancied.
</p><p>Among them, there happened graphical sketches like that one copied from the landscape around a construction site: "the apple of sky skewered with the blade of sunbeam..."; or those marked by their onomatopoeic stickiness: "Carkalomna barcarole..."; or philosophical pieces like that about God devoured the day before; and simply rhythmic chants for marching: "what do we laugh at?."...)
</p></div><p>One of the first pieces I showed Eera, and she cocked up at once – who was that Madonna in a padded workman jacket?
As if I could know, just one of those queuing in the workmen canteen at the midday break.
</p><p>As for "To the Tune of V. Kosma" she did not ask anything, it was about her, undoubtedly and clear. Later, she said that they told her it was a good poem, and I stopped showing her any of them.
Probably, I was jealous of the unidentified someone, to whom she gave it for evaluation.
</p><p>When I read to my brother Sasha "The Scythian Interview", his reaction was instantaneous, "You have to be ratted on!"
</p><div id="span"><p>(...if your poetry piece turns an ombre's train of thoughts in the KGB direction, it holds a worthy idea...)
</p></div><p>Ivan, a carpenter from SMP-615, somehow liked the line about a cabbage leaf on the knife blade's edge. After six months, he asked to recite for him about that cabbage once again; I'd never imagine the bulky block had a sweet tooth for salads.
</p><p>At times, when at the end of a midday break there still remained five minutes before to leave the trailer and go on with laying the walls, the women on our team asked to read something new, and the recital would be concluded by Grinya’s yelling: "Sehryoga! They do not shoe horses with fire, there are horseshoes for that! Gelding you are ungroomed!"
He was brought up and educated in the village of Krasnoye on the Baturin highway and should know such things better.
</p><p>When the number of poems exceeded a score, my attitude to them changed qualitatively. Why should they lay around? Ain't it a pity?
And I started to send them to the editorial offices of diverse monthlies and publishing houses, just like Martin Eden from the same-named novel by Jack London.
And they kept returning back to me, exactly as his ones to him, with typewritten responses, which looked like one and the same carbon-copied answer.
</p><p>They informed that the material received from me was inconsistent with the thematic orientation of their publication, besides, their editorial portfolio was filled for three to four upcoming years, yet not a single word about the verses themselves.
Thus, Grinya's review remained unsurpassed: "Gelding ungroomed!"
</p><p>However, the literary collaborator at one of the journals shared, that a similar style was the vogue in the 1930s.
Probably, he aimed to point out the deprecated nature of the stuff, but it rather made me happy – they recognized poems as having some sort of style!
</p><div id="span"><p>(...and what a style it was!
In the 1930s the Union of Writers had not been gelded yet with political purges and spy-hunting repressions.
In those days people still wrote poetry and not conjuncture-prone materials dedicated to the nearing Party Congresses...)
</p></div><p>It gradually began to dawn on me that none of the eggheads, slurping from the trough of literary collaboration, was  interested in all those poetic "beam blades in the sky" any more than in prosaic skewers in their personal ass.
</p><p>The final eye-opener arrived with the response from the monthly<em> Moscow</em> to "Tired Alla".
A fleeting glance made it quite clear that the literary collaborator perused the suggested piece in the most serious and conscientious way. The meaning of a certain word in the second stanza was not quite evident for him, so he took pains to check the term with a dictionary...
He forgot to erase the working marks of his assiduous pencil in my verse. The word "craving" remained underlined and its interpretation—"lust"—was added nearby.
</p><p>I did not know which dictionary he used to dig it out, but the result offended me.
The ultimate blow was dealt by the name of the reviewer who signed the response – Pushkin! Aw, fuck!
The mental picture of Pushkin looking up "craving" in a dictionary made me draw the line under my fucking  editors' brains with my f-f..er..formidable, I mean, simplicity.
I realized at last, that I was not a Martin Eden and it was anything but America around.
</p><p>The realization of my non-American origin and whereabouts cut postal expenses for envelopes and registered letters.
Sending such a letter was not big deal though, about fifty kopecks, the equivalent of two "Belomor-Canal" cigarette packs because  the cost of living in the Soviet Union was fairly reasonable, and treatment of askew illusions, practically, free of charge...
</p><p>In summer, you came to Konotop again, yet  without any carriage already.
Our team was working at the 50-apartment block near the Under-Overpass, and one of the riggers, Katerina it was, shouted from the ground that I had visitors.
I went downstairs and to the sidewalk outside the gate.
</p><p>You stood next to Eera who was wearing a red sarafan with white Mongolian patterns. I don't remember what you had on, but I do remember how lovely you were smiling...
I gently lowered my plastic helmet onto your straight fair hair, and its visor slid down to touch your nose but it failed to put out your happy smile...
I remember that smile from under my helmet.
</p><p>In a couple of minutes, you both went on down the sidewalk and I watched, and the riggers, Katerina and Vera Sharapova, they also watched from behind the gate, suddenly so silent and pensive, because such beauty was going away – a woman in red, hand in hand with a child of fair straight hair.
</p><p>You had just turned three years old, and I decided that the best gift for you would be a familiar face among the strangers at  Decemberists 13.
I went to Nezhin and, despite my tongue-tied speaking manner, did manage to convince Tonya to let her son go with me to your birthday in Konotop, provided that my father-in-law would arrive the following day and take him back.
Tonya was a really brave woman, she was not afraid of my reputation, drenched beyond any hope for restoration after Romny.
</p><p>The local train was overcrowded and for about an hour we had to stand in the aisle, vacant seats appeared only about the station of Bakhmach.
But how happy you and Igor turned when I brought him to  Decemberists 13! A fountain of joyful squeals!.
</p><p>The following week my vacation began and four of us—you, Eera, I and Lenochka—went to the Seim with a permit to the RepBase recreation camp  procured by my parents for us.
It was a wide grounds whose low plank fence enclosed a few large pines and several wooden cabins with four beds in each and windows on all the sides, like a veranda.
When we first went to the river beach, everyone there got just stupefied, they never saw a Greek goddess go, moreover with so snow-white a skin as Eera's.
</p><p>Another day the four of us went hunting mushrooms in the forest plantation nearby the village of Khutor Taransky.
Halfway there, we met a pair of horses, but I worried only about Eera, she always was afraid of those animals.
</p><p>The forest planting was of young pines lined up in parallel ranks. Long spider webs stretching across the passages between the lined trees made the plantation almost impassable, but there were suillus under the pine needles layer on the ground.
We were combing through the corridors walled with the pine trunks, forth and back.
You grew thirsty and I asked Lenochka to take you to the camp—the path was wide and it was no more than just three hundred meters—because I wanted Eera all too madly.
</p><p>For a long time you did not want to go with your sister before, finally, you agreed, but a moment later your loud crying rang along the pine corridor, and Lenochka explained that you did not listen to her at all, although there were no horses anymore.
</p><p>In the evening, there was a thunderstorm and downpour, but you were not afraid and only laughed because I was laying on my bed and you were stomping on my stomach.
Someone's joy might hurt someone else – at your three years you were a weighty kid, but Eera cried out to be patient with my own child.
I endured a little more and then I hardly managed to persuade you that's enough, please.
</p><p>It was a good summer…</p>
