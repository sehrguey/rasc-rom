<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Parade of Planets<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>At the intercity phone calls station on Pushkin Street, they played a good joke on me.
That time I made the order and waited, then went out through the porchless  door wide-open onto the sidewalk. The moment I lit a cigarette, the loudspeaker inside shouted, "Nezhin! Is anyone waiting for Nezhin?!"
I threw the cigarette into a trash bin by the door and ran back. "It's me! I am waiting!"
</p><p>To which the telephone operator said on her microphone, "So, wait then!"
The crowd in the hall split their sides. That again, they were saving me from something.
</p><p>Some cat was waiting there too. They announced his number connected, "Chelyabinsk on line! Enter Booth 5!"
And before going to where was told, he uttered with a bitter disappointment, "Eew!"
</p><p>That's an enlightened one! By the booth number alone, he knew beforehand the pending talk’s outcome!.
</p><p>I got to know Odessa very well. On foot, for the most part.
I found the Public Library Nr. 2; and Privvoz bazaar, where the porters in blue robes pushed station trolleys in front of them shouting "Feet! Feet!", so that the crowd would give way to them with their shortened "Watch your feet!".
</p><p>There, in Privvoz, an old gypsy cast a curse on me with their witchcraft art; I did not get it what for, but she should know better...
</p><p>Factory of Gastric Juice; who would ever imagine there were such enterprises?!.
When I was passing through the yards of five-story blocks, mujiks at their "goat" game  would bang the bones louder against the tables to shoo off the cats, so they would not run across the sidewalk in front of me. Also allies...
</p><p>To Odessa I was going by bus, only a couple of times on foot; it's only twenty kilometers or so all in all.
And one time I walked from Vapnyarka to New Dophinovka along the seashore, over the cliff. In one place there stood some military installation behind the fence of barbed wire. The sentry yelled from there it was forbidden to pass by their site, approached and demanded to present my papers.
</p><p>I showed through the wire my handkerchief with the sailing boat in the circle. He realized at once that the level was different, "Okay, get along..."
</p><p>From up the cliff, the view was very beautiful. The sea was quiet, almost smooth, yet sparkled and glittered under the sun. Sometimes the wind rushed along to ripple the water and draw various types of galaxies. Spiral, for the most part. The wind was copying them from the clouds that hovered above the sea…
</p><p>In Streetcar 5 going to the Arcadia beach, I saw Gray from our Stavropol construction battalion.
It surprised me a little – four years had passed and he remained looking so young and, for some reason, in the  black uniform of a sea cadet, in their cap with the ribbons hanging over the back.
</p><p>I stood up and quietly asked into his ear, "Gray, is it you?"
He did not respond, neither moved the tiniest bit although he heard me, dead sure...
</p><p>And another time it was my father by a newsagent booth. He did not look like my father at all, I only recognized him by his voice. It was in that exactly voice he told me of the murderer, whom the camp director brought to a new murder.
</p><p>When he spoke to me, I pretended that I was all too busy examining a portrait of psychiatrist Burdenko in the <em>Ogonyok</em> magazine cover, which hung behind the glass of the booth, so it was the seller who responded to him.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...confronted with the meetings of such a kind, anyone will start asking themselves: what's going on?
But you can't get an answer to it if having no grasp on the conception of monad.
</p><p>Monad is a made in Germany gadget for philosophizing, which everyone understands to their personal liking.
For someone, it might mean a singularity from a set, while for someone else – a whole set of singularities.
</p><p>For example, when a guy asks his girl, "Tell me! Am I just another one of many for you, or the only one from all their many?"
Here, the second "one" in his question is that very monad or, maybe, vice versa...
</p><p>In some Indian Bible, there is a gaudy picture of a baby that crawls over the grass, a step ahead of him, a kid is running, before whom there walks a man just about to overtake a withered old geezer, and then again only the green of the grass.
The picture is called "The Circle of Life".
That is, from nothing to nothing.
</p><p>Now, together, they all comprise one monad because it's the same person.
</p><p>So, it only remains to assume, that monads can be formed in a different way; for example, by the timbre of a voice; and everything falls into place.
It depends on the standpoint from which you are viewing the monad: here – it's your father, while on its other end – a homeless drifter speaks up to you by the stall with Burdenko.
</p><p>Of course, all that is a bit more complicated than to learn by rote: "if you stumbled with your left leg – everything would be okay, but if it was the right one – don't even try, turn back and go home", however,  monad, as abstruse and hardly comprehensible as it is,  still explains a lot...)
</p></div><p>A certain Odessa Preferans player in his youth was a part to the illegal underground. But later he reformed and began to collaborate with the television studio of Odessa as a commentator on the latest criminal news. He even wrote a book sharing impressions from his bandit past, in which he claims that the year of your birth, and especially the summer period, was marked by an unseen, critically baneful, surge of violent crime in Odessa.
</p><p>It’s a very rare case when a printed text failed to convince me because that summer I was there in person and never noticed anything of the kind. Which speaks in favor of the theory about the existence of parallel worlds. The reformed commentator and I lived in separate parallel worlds, therefore each of us was receiving different impressions from different worlds both of which had in common only the ordinal number of their current year.
</p><p>In all of my reiterations to and detours within Odessa, I happened to observe just two occasions of contact and reciprocative penetration of our parallel worlds.
The first one occurred on the morning bus Gvardeyskoye-Odessa when a young slob from the second seat on the left rebuked the driver for a minor change in the route through   the city outskirts.
</p><p>Upon arrival at the bus station by the New Bazaar, the driver hurried from his cabin into the bus with apologies and technical (to some extent too-too obsequious) explanations.
He was forgiven when the other passenger on the same seat spoke for him to her easily irritable companion...</p>
