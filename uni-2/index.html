 <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part two)<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>That was exactly what I dreamed about, or rather did not allow myself even to dream of in all those two years, that in the morning I'd wake up not from the bellow of an on-duty jerk but because of a female embrace, that of Olga. She came home from work, lay atop of me, hugged through the blanket, and I awakened to answer her kiss.
 Our talk somehow did not come out well, if an exchange of one-word clues could be called a talk at all.
 And we looked at each other in such a manner that my mother, who was on her vacation, promptly took our daughter Lenochka and went to Bazaar...
</p><p> Everything in life is surely repeating itself. What was, will be there again. The difference, if any,  is slightly made by  circumstantial details...
 For instance, that my mother returned from Bazaar (and not from a store) without oranges, and that nothing restrained me this time...
 As for the hieroglyphics left on my wrist by the claws of that hotel sadist, Olga, sure enough, marked them well, studied attentively and read their message, but not out loud. Actually, I did not insist on her sharing the obtained information.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...nothing has more flexile nature than time.
 The current year  lasts elastically without showing any wish for termination, while a year lived through shinks into a mere point of time.
</p><p>A point has no length whatsoever, it ends at its own start. So, tell me any good reason to consider   shorter stretches than a year as having even a point's worth.
 Really, what can you say about the last month? That it had several Fridays and there was thirteenth  among its  dates. Right.
 And about the last hour? Oh, yes! It had sixty minutes...
Empty term-juggling, jejune number re-shuffle.
</p><p>A decade, when lived through, turns into a same-size point.
 After that point idled at school, a person begins to grow bristles. Another such point spent at Zona brings about aching joints (especially in the right shoulder), yet it still is just a point...)
</p></div><p>A week after the demobilization, the two-year eternity at the construction battalion became mere scraps of memories pinned onto a point in the past.
 The flow of ever-moving life carries all those points off, to hell or whatever other destination, and it does not matter where exactly, because you don't have time to ponder on such matters but have a more urgent task – to get along the streaming flow of life…
 </p><p>When bathing, there are two ways of entering the water. With the first, you go into it step by step, with your shoulders pulled up, rising on the tiptoes as the bottom grows deeper.
 </p><p>The other way is entering the water until it's knee-deep and with a yell (or bypassing it) to plunge headlong forward...
It was time for me to dip into civilian life...
  </p><p>Overseer Borya Sakoon died and never kept his promise to retire in four years.
  </p><p>The Arkhipenkos moved to the Kamchatka Peninsular, which, reportedly, was Fishermen’s Paradise with fish jumping into your skiff of their free will.
 </p><p>My brother and sister graduated the Railway Transportation School and were sent to repay for their diplomas with work at the exploration and construction of railways somewhere in the Urals between Ufa and Orenburg.
 </p><p>Vladya and Chuba returned from the army half-year before me and had time enough to get streamlined with the concurrent life-flow.
 Skully had developed a solid bold patch over his head and was looking forward to becoming twenty-seven – which age ended draft liability of a USSR citizen. He was exempted from the army as the only breadwinner for his single mother with her single mother, God save them until his coming of the right age!
</p><p>I was not much amused with my re-appearance in the Konotop polite society.
 We gathered at the Vlady's, I stuffed a blunt, yet my friends did but a couple of drags each, just for civility's sake...
 From Vlady's <em>khutta </em>we ventured to the Loony park where The Spitzes were playing dances. When passing Deli 6, Vladya farted at a lighted match held by Skully close to his ass. The emitted ammonia flared up in a blue bunch of flame. It did not delight me though, in the construction battalion, I had seen all sorts of the like tricks and did not care for wanton commemoratives.
</p><p>In general, my way of getting on high wasn't fine with them, and theirs didn't turn me on. We remained friends but in the course of our subsequent lives, we streamed, basically, in separate parts of the flow…
 </p><p>I borrowed <em>The Adventures of Captain Blood</em> from the Club library but couldn't read even a half of the rubbish which once upon a time was my regular thrill...
 </p><p>"What do you keep in the newspaper on top of the wardrobe?" asked Olga.
 </p><p>"A spike condom. Wanna try?"
 </p><p>"No!"
 </p><p> I was sure though she had checked it before asking, or did I overestimate her?.
 </p><p>When having a walk, she introduced me to an unknown squirt in the common stream – her co-worker from the brick factory who we met near Deli 1.
</p><p>A mujik over thirty said his name, I answered with mine, and we immediately forgot what had just heard. I did not like his smile that bared the over-worn gums receding to the teeth roots. Besides, some uneasiness about him made it clear that the meeting and new acquaintance was no  good news to him; I regretted we had come up to him at all...
 </p><p>And on the other side of the Under-Overpass, near Deli 5, it was already we to be approached by a half-acquaintance Halimonenko, handled Halimon, who demanded of Olga a private talk.
 She asked me to wait and walked with him four meters aside on the same two-step porch in front of Deli 5.
 </p><p>Some scraps of words in their conference: "militia", "get not a little" were reaching  me.
 It was unpleasant to stand pushed aside that way, but so I’d been asked.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...another of my pesky traits is doing what they've asked me without giving it a thought and starting to think when it's too late...)
</p></div><p>Their conversation ended and she returned to me followed by his owner-like "I told you!".
 Olga explained that someone attempted at stealing Halimon's motorcycle from his <em>khatta's</em>  shed and he mistakenly concluded she had anything to do with all that.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...myths are different.
 There are useful ones, like the myths of ancient Greece, and useless as, for instance, that the army turns young men into manly men.
 </p><p>Bullshit! Were it so, I'd say to Halimon, "This is my woman, talk to me!"
 It's not that I was afraid of him, it simply never occurred to me to say so.
 The army hadn't made a man of me...)
</p></div><p>Olga suggested going to the Plant Park on Saturday, where the dances were played by The Pesnedary, a group from Bakhmach. Their native town was the fourth stop of a local train going from Konotop to Kiev, so it took just a half-hour ride to get there. What kind of group could be from such a backwater?
 Yet, Olga said they still played well, besides, at the dances, she'd introduce me to Valentin Batrak, handled Lyalka, the brother of Vitya Batrak, handled Slave.
</p><p>The <em>lahboohs</em> from Bakhmuch sounded very good thanks to their keyboard player – a long guy sporting the hairstyle of Angela Devis. They quite decently performed "Smoke on the Water" of The Deep Purple, as well as "Mexico" of The Chicago band.
 Then we were approached by Lyalka and Olga introduced us to each other.
</p><p>Tall and skinny, with the long fair hair slightly cocked up atop of the head, he had a same-colored nail-beard à la Cardinal Richelieu. A single look at each other's enlightened eyes prompted us that we needed a more secluded place than the dance-floor.
 Such a place was found and there we exchanged the credentials and reached consensus in the estimation of the sampled weed's quality, which contributed to establishing relations of friendship and cooperation for the years to come…</p>
