 <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
     <p>
She invited the guest to the table.
Supping the meal, the schoolboy looked at the window with a detached stare.
Could you remember what they see with such wide-open gaze those seven-year-old aliens until another question about school brings them back to their senses?
</p><p>Well, at least the unknown uncle from nowhere was eating silently.
The boiled potatoes with fried onions the boy rejected, as well as the tea.
</p><p>The grandmother sent him to the village smithy to tell his grandfather about the guest, who with a polite ‘thank-you’ returned to the couch...
Full of lean satiety, he sat in dense sleepy silence wrapping the house.
</p><p>Outside the two windows behind his back, the gray wind cooed and wooed with impetuous gusts the apple tree in the front garden, who angrily waved away the inconstant any lady's man...
It's time to insert the inner frames for winter...
I front of him, through the velvety-lilac night, the kidnappers were still galloping mutely with their capture.
Although she might be happy to be stolen and not stay by the old vizier with his fat eunuchs…
</p><p>It's weird, the extent of how fully everything around was befitting me.
And so it would be on all the following days of the vacation...
In the evenings I'd be visiting my aunt Alexandra to overeat her pancakes, and once even a chicken. Some rich villager was my aunt.
</p><p>In the mornings after breakfast, when my uncle, the blacksmith, went by bicycle to his smithy, I ventured to roam over the fields, and after the midday meal, I was cutting logs from the hillock of firewood dumped next to the house, for the winter.
</p><p>A beautiful Russian woman Valentina, by her husband's last name – Zhelezina, my cousin and the mother of Maxim, the outstanding student living in the house of his grandparents, would encourage me to visit her house, where she kept the younger ones – the hooligan Volodka and post-toddler Tanyooshka, who still did not want to part with her pacifier.
</p><p>She would retell me the village gossips, and her life in Moscow, where she was courted by a Frenchman, and in Kustanai, where she was married to a German from the local colonists.
</p><p>Her current husband would take me to the village store, and I would drink bottled beer and listen to mujiks' talk of nothing but with so native intonations that it takes your breath away with the sentimental sympathy.
</p><p>And by that time my aunt would have already bestowed a black padded jacket, which was the obligatory outfit for anyone there, except for kids and teenagers, so that I did not stick out like a sore thumb in my checkered jacket...
</p><p>Some ante-biblical simplicity of life, and at the same time with so many admixtures...
An old woman came to the store to exchange potatoes from her garden for kolkhoz kopecks, her utter poverty showed through but the mujiks around were next to bowing, caps in hand, before her.
She’s a relic of their past – the embodiment of the old-regime landowners, yet they needed that relic and would create it from a poor retired teacher if only her facial features were delicate enough...
</p><p>Returning from one of the supper evenings at my aunt's, I, for some reason, stopped in my tracks at nothing around, and for a long stretch was staring in the dry tall grass. What for?.
The next evening my aunt affirmed that, yes, my grandmother Martha's hut had been exactly in that spot.
</p><p>On the last night before leaving, I came with the farewell visit to Valentina's house.
My checkered jacket turned out exactly her husband's size, they were obviously impressed with such generosity and were calling the jacket "a suit".
To Valentina, I presented my suspiciously feminine bag. I did manage to get rid of it after all...
</p><p>We went out into the darkness of the street without houses. Everyone understood that we would never see each other again.
Valentina embraced me and wept. I stroke the shoulder of her padded jacket and said, "Boodya, sister." Then I shook hands with her husband Zhelezin and went away.
</p><p>It's so strange, in my whole life, I never heard or used that soothing word of "boodya", it came out all by itself, spontaneously...
I come from here, it's where I belong, sad pity I’ll be of no use for my own…
</p><p>People started making wry faces at me as early as the bus station near the Izmaylovo Park, where the Ryazan-Moscow bus arrived.
At Zhulyany airport in Kiev, where I disembarked the midnight flight from Moscow, the hostile attitude to me from the folks around increased exponentially to confirm the correctness of the old saying – people judge you by your <em>zek </em>outfit.
</p><p>The public opinion on my account was voiced in the morning by a passenger on the platform in the underground metro station, "Where the fuck do you barge through among the people?"
</p><p>I differed from them by my being a black man. The black padded jacket, black pants, black army boots. Only the "cock" hat on my head fell out of the ensemble with its brown and blue stripes.
It would seem more or less excusable were I loaded with some kind of luggage, but a black man with his hands in his pockets is outrageous, it's a challenge to the social order, it's a cheeky <em>bomzh...</em>
We bypass them with an unseeing glance, so that to avoid any eye contact—save, God!—or we bark, "Where the fuck do you barge through among the people?"
</p><p>True, in those days we did not know the word<em> bomzh</em> yet, and for such sort of people, they used the term <em>bich</em>.
"Where do you barge, you <em>bich</em>?.. Get out of here, fucking <em>bich</em>!"
</p><p>The word was brought by the seamen who had sailed abroad.
There, in the port cities, the drifters spending nights on the beach, collecting the scraps and offal left by vacationers were called "beach-combers". Our people did not care for the whole word and borrowed only the first half of it.
So the folks without a certain place of residence and of obscure occupation got labeled<em> biches</em>. A short, biting term. However, it died out.
</p><p>Firstly, those who did not speak English and never went to the sea began to slip into synonyms, substituting <em>knoot</em> (which in Russian means "whip") for <em>bich</em> that in Russian also means "whip".
And, secondly,  abbreviations are always stronger, especially when  supported by the state.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...we are all from the USSR, got it?
Whoever does not understand will receive clarification in the CheKa, aka the KGB...)
</p></div><p>When the law enforcement organs abbreviated the "without a certain place of residence" that turned in Russian into BOMZh, other terms had no chance for survival.
</p><p>In the great and mighty Russian language, you cannot find a synonym to<em> bomzh.</em>
The nearest to it "tramp" or "bum" smack of mothballs and infantile lisp of the Indian cinema…
</p><p>Once upon a time in Russia there lived peddlers, aka <em>offenny</em>. In order to survive, they invented a language of their own.
Dark for uninitiated, the Offenny language went into oblivion together with its carriers – no one  bothered to compose its dictionary.
</p><p>The current <em>fenya</em> of the criminal world is also for initiated but has nothing to do with the defunct Offenny except for echoing the latter's name.
Considering <em>fenya</em> the language of Russian mafia is not correct because from Russian it borrowed only grammatical structures, and the vocabulary is fairly international.
Kicked out of secondary school, half-educated students when continuing their careers as jail-birds poured in <em>fenya</em> the bits and scraps of words they heard at foreign language classes.
That way <em>fenya </em>feathered its hat with <em>atas!</em> (from the French "atasion!"), <em>haza </em>(from the German "Hause"), <em>havvat</em> (from the English "have a"), as well as manifold borrowings from the languages in the family of friendly and free brother nations fused into the common, undividable, USSR.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...however, back to my <em>malyava</em>, aka letter (<em>fenya’s</em> term from the German "mahlen")...)
</p></div><p>The champion for the public fundamental morals, who offended me in the metro, had no notion that under the appearance of a black man there lived in me a  vulnerable tender soul as well as the digestive tract of a delicate constitution.
I did not suspect it myself until I felt how, after the mentioned insult, I gradually became "mournful in the belly" because the intestines began revolting after the traumatic discovery that in public eye they were a constituent part of a bum.
</p><p>About the Maidan, which then was named Square of October Revolution, it became clear that I could not hold back the pressure of the tides that stormed the ampoule (which follows the large intestine) and that there remained no hope for reaching the greens by the University, with the only public toilet known to me in the central part of Kiev.
Fortunately, I remembered the Ministry of Education with their ministerial toilet on the second floor, and not too far from the square, it’s only that the intemperately intensive rioting within my system called for additional suppressive efforts…
</p><p>I flung the tall entrance door open and rushed, in a concentrated jog, up the marble stairs.
</p><p>"Hey! Where?" shouted the attendant from the chair to the left from the entrance.
</p><p>"Plumbing equipment check," reported I over my shoulder, without slowing down the businesslike strides...
</p><p>When all the sorrows subsided, I left the restroom, polished like a malachite jewelry case, and descended the wide white stairs, with the demeanor of archangel Gabriel in dignified idle stroll and, maybe,  even gleaming blissfully.
</p><p>I wanted to share the Good News and, turning my face to the attendant, informed benevolently, "Hey, look! The check says it's okay around here. Yea!."
And I went out into the blatantly atheistic Karl Marx Street, between two dense walls of the like, severely administrative, buildings.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...Karl certainly knew it's only thanks to the collective efforts that Man managed to become Crown of Nature.
Because  single-handed you can neither kill a mammoth not fly to the moon.
</p><p>But how fragile the state of unity is!.
How willingly and readily we do divide ourselves, humans, by the color of skin and hair, by caste, faith, party affiliation: they are not us, we are not them, we're  more expensive, at least by one ruble...
</p><p>Some unsolvable mystery – how the assemblage of  ape-shaped boobs keeps able for collective achievements, given their chronic proneness to self-castration?..)</p>
