 <br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p> It was a sunny Sunday morning when I went out of Nezhin Street to the tramway stop by our school to wait for a streetcar because the prestigious School 11 was on the other side of the Under-Overpass, halfway between it and the Railway Station.
</p><p>The Settlement red streetcar with its round, kinda clown’s nose, lamp beneath the driver cab windshield clanged up to the stop. Under the nose-lamp, there was the inventory number of the car – 33.
</p><p>Fully aware that all that was a pure nonsense and stupid superstition, I, nonetheless, did not feel like letting such an opportunity pass by, to wit, when you happened to come across a doubled digit, like, 22 or 77 and so forth, in a car license plate, or in the number printed on your movie ticket, or on the ticket handed to you by a streetcar conductor, you were in luck, dead sure.
 Just don't omit secure it by balling your fist and pronouncing the inaudible incantation, “The luck is mine. Full-stop!”
 Which I did.
 </p><p>At the Olympiad, in the group of fourteen-year-old students from the fourteen city schools, I solved some of the problems about acceleration, and specific weight, and density, but not all.
 </p><p>To the concluding question: “Why do we first see the lightning and only then hear the thunder?”, I even draw a pencil sketch explaining the time interval between the flash and the bang.
 </p><p>Next week, Binkin, with an unconcealed surprise, announced that I took the first place among the eighth-graders at the city Olympiad of Physics.
 </p><p>I did not know whether the number under the streetcar’s nose really brought luck, or the solution checkers were impressed with the clumsy lightning, but it’s nice to realize that you had beaten both a representative of the prestigious School 11 and even a guy from School 12 with its mathematical specialization...
 Now, get it, blockheads, from the Plant Settlement guys!.
 </p><p>“The Dead Season” was on the show at  Club.
 The three of us bought tickets to ensure the show because, at times when no tickets were sold, the projectionists refused to show the film for only the check-passers.
 However, the audience turned out big enough; not as many as at the Indian “Zita and Guita” but no less than a quarter of the auditorium got filled.
</p><p>The movie was about our secret agent in the United States starring Donatas Banionis from “No One Wanted to Die” where he got shot and killed in the end and collapsed on the desk with the unfinished note he was writing.
 </p><p>And in America, they followed him for a long time, then caught and jailed for twenty years, but then exchanged for a CIA agent caught in the Soviet Union.
 </p><p>A black-and-white film, yet of the wide-screen format and Banionis had on a luxurious white shirt. You could see at glance that it was no nylon, but he wore that shirt even when cooking in the kitchen, just slightly turned the sleeves up.
 A cool movie, in general.
 </p><p>When it was over, we slowly moved towards the exit, envious that some folks managed to live interesting lives.
  And then Kuba clapped his muskrat-fur hat against his fist and said, “Okay! First thing in the morning to see Solovey about the  secret agents school enrollment!”
 Skully and I laughed to exhaustion because Solovey was Precinct Militiamen at the Settlement.
</p><p>Actually, no one ever referred to him as “Precinct Militiaman”, they just uttered “Solovey” and everyone got it at once.
  When he entered Bazar, a muffled “Sol!..- Sol!..- Sol!..” swished over the counters and crowding caboodle. The old peasant women from Podlipnoye or Popovka buried deeper in their bags the glass jars and rubber hot water bottles with the hooch, to make them out of sight. Then they turned to the legitimate part of their trade standing behind the counter with a cup of black seeds, or a braid of onions – law-abiding goods.
</p><p>But no horsing about Solovey’s sniff flair! And more than once, under loud curses from the trader, he poured onto the ground the bootlegged “samohrie” confiscated from her gunny sack.
 Once, an alky from the crowd could not stand the temptation, he fell on his four bones and lapped the hooch from the puddle. Solovey swooped at him,  drove his boot a couple of times against the rummy's ribs, but the sot was in the Lap of Happiness already. Then the vehicle arrived and took him to the Sobering-up Station.
</p><p>Occasionally, Solovey got his share too, and more than once they would trap him someplace in the dark and warm up with a blizzard of beating. One time they poured kerosene over him and set on fire, in another sorting out his both arms were broken with a crowbar.
 Well, the guys would get their times to serve, he’d recover and again – to Bazaar, in his red-topped militiaman cap, and there again, “Sol!..- Sol!..- Sol!..”
</p><p>So, Kuba made a good one about becoming a secret serviceman through Solovey…
 </p><p>During the winter holidays, the winners in the Olympiad of Physics were taken to the city of Sumy, for the Regional Olympiad.
  In the Konotop group, there were four boys and a girl, a ninth-grader, though she looked quite an adult girl.
 </p><p>In Sumy, we were accommodated for a night stay in a hotel. The number of boys coincided with the number of beds in the room. Our mentor, who was a teacher from School 12 with its Math and Physics specialization, stayed somewhere farther along the corridor, and the girl-like-an-adult in some female number.
 </p><p>Soon everyone gathered in our room around a two-volumed paperback <em>Collection of Tasks and Exercises in Physics for Matriculants </em>brought in by the head of the group.
 </p><p>Gee! I had never seen such books and, until that moment,  believed in earnest that school textbooks were all there was in Physics. It was a misconception.
 </p><p>The rest of the future Einsteins from Konotop met both Collections as their good acquaintances and even bosom friends. They began to actively discuss in which sections there were especially complex tasks and in which not so much so.
 </p><p>The teacher offered to work out some of the tasks, just for a knock-up. Everyone immediately fell to scribbling formulas and explaining them to each other.
 I was “the sixth odd” at their laborious party. Those exercises advanced far beyond the problems which Binkin solved with us on the class blackboard.
 </p><p>Then we went out to the city to have a meal at a canteen. On the way back, I lagged to furtively admire the gait of the girl-like-an-adult.
  The green coat fitted tight her wide figure and every step produced oblique folds in the coat’s fabric on her back. Flick to the right, flick to the left. Hither-thither. Flick-flick.
 </p><p>In fact, besides the long coat, high boots, and a knitted hat, there was nothing to look at but those rhythmic folds on her back, yet, falling back to the Onegin’s epoch cant, they drove me crazy.
 </p><p>Though seemingly a fiddle-faddle, those folds were not a trifle for the connoisseur and collector of the like gems. Some books were reread for more than once just because I knew there were a couple of lines “about it”. A couple of miserly lines, but they contained a specific detail, which I would put into my secret casket for later use.
 </p><p>For instance, in a sci-fi story by Harry Harrison about the time machine, a film-shooting crew jumped over into the year of one thousand, to make an action movie. Their male star had an accident there, and they had to replace him with an available local Viking.
 </p><p>Now, the film director instructs that newly baked Schwarzenegger his action in the next scene: “You rush into a bedroom in the castle you’ve just seized. You see a half-awake beauty and throw away your weapon.
  Sit down on the bed next to her and slowly move her brassiere strap to fall from her shoulder.
  That’s all! The scene is done. Everything else is left to the imagination of film-goers, which you can safely bet your bottom dollar on.”
 </p><p>Aha! That’s the long-awaited-for detail! The brassiere strap sliding smoothly from the soft round shoulder…
 No messing around with a vague “kiss on the sugar-sweet lips” for you.
 </p><p>And the same evening, with the blanket pulled over my head and the eyes closed tightly, I burst into a half-asleep beauty’s bedroom. But, of course, without any stupid cameras and highlights; I am not a movie Viking but a real-life one, and it’s the real Middle Ages we are having around here.
 I throw away my shield and sword and flick her brassier strap off.
</p><p>At first, she resists but after taking a more attentive look at the regular features of my face, she willingly spreads over the bed. I roll on top of her body… A hot wave floods the lower part of my belly… My dick twitches in the boner… My eyes are shut…
  And I…
  What?!!.
 </p><p>I do not know what comes next.
 So, it’s time to take a rest before another dive into the coveted casket for some other secret detail to start building up a new situation by using it it to eventually bring about the painfully sweet state of cursed ignorance.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…Leo Tolstoy fervently advocated against male masturbation.
</p><p>Any seasoned saint starts their career in a form of unscrupulous sinner, otherwise, they would miss the stage of self-denying in their spiritual growth which is just null and void if the pains of disentangling from the ties to brute creation level were omitted.
</p><p>I cannot  draw a precise conclusion whether my erection orgies might be classified as a commonplace masturbation.
  On the one hand, there was no dick chafing applied through the noose-like grip of palm contraption, and I had never cum.
 But on the other hand, what if that was just introductory warming, kinda mental knock up?
 What if not for presence of my brother, sniffling peacefully next to me on the folding couch-bed, I’d go astray, swap reaching the boner by handless erotic speculations for traditionally  tangible tactile toil and join the ranks of 95 percent of all male mankind with Leo Tolstoy and choryphaei of Italian cinematography in the head of the procession?.)
 </p></div><p>Once in the schoolyard, Kuba asked keenly, “Did you know, that wanking causes hair-growth on your palms?”
 </p><p>Skully and I simultaneously looked in our hands, to the Kuba’s happy guffaw.
 I knew that my palms were sinless, but I looked all the same; out of pure instinct.
</p><p>So, as it turns out, those folds, flicking this way and that way in front of me, were not a negligible trifle. Maybe at some future session of my contactless masturbation, the green coat would open and a tender voice would call softly, “Are you also cold? Come closer. Let’s warm each other…”
 And I…
 What?!.
 </p><p>In the evening the mentor brought the same volumes again and persistingly suggested to pay attention to exercises of such and such numbers.
 The winners gave them short shrift, and I only looked silently over their shoulders keeping the countenance of an inveterate problem cracker…</p>
