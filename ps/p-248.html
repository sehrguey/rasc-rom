     <p>
I handed Salinger to Zhomnir and in return, I asked for James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>, 705 pages of dense text without pictures, without divisions into parts or chapters.
Zhomnir himself once wanted to translate it, but Joyce turned out way too unsuitable for any conjuncture.
I gave my word to return the volume in ten years.
</p><p>After a split-second hesitation, he brought the book out of his archive chamber and handed it to me. Now I had with what to fill the eternity ahead of me.
</p><p>"Where are you going?" asked Maria Antonovna.
</p><p>"To Baku."
</p><p>With the usual jerk, the train pulled out of the Nezhin railway station...
Everything was behind, ahead was everything.
Thirty and three years.
</p><p>"It's time for you to work miracles,"  said I to a saxophonist I knew, when he became thirty-three.
</p><p>"I have already done miracles," he replied, "And did my time for them as well."
And how only do them folks manage to live eventful lives?
</p><p>I thought that I was going to Baku to pick up a job of a bricklayer of the fourth category, and gradually translate<em> Ulysses</em> after  work.
As it turned out, I was starting to the Mountainous Karabakh with its war for independence and all the issuing details common for such cases, which I'd rather not dwell on.
However, behind the windows of the local train car, there still were running familiar landscapes of 1987, the last year of peace.
Before the collapse of the indestructible Union of the Free Republics, there still remained two years.
Today, they tell me that in 1987 the smack of the new era was in the air already. Alas, I did not scent the brew.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...what was the underlying reason for the collapse of the USSR?
The Union was finished off by "The Guys on the Roadside".
So was named the English TV movie of four sequels about the life of British unemployed.
</p><p>The censors at the central television in Moscow did not get it that at the end of that week an electrician at the "Motordetail" plant would say: "I have been working all my life, and so has my wife. Our son returned from the army and he also works now. We have a two-room apartment, and their unemployed live in two-story cottages! Fuck!"
The magic power of art touched the living strings in the heart of a Konotop mujik, triggering the chain reaction that changed the face of the world.
</p><p>Has it changed its essence, or was it just a case of plastic surgery?..)
</p></div><p>Let some other "I", not a part to my personal monad, strain their brains about this question, because the predawn twilight, seeping through the synthetic canvass of my Chinese tent, signals the end to this sleepless night and also to this endless letter.
</p><p>You will ask, how did my following life flow, behind the watershed of the Caucasian ridge?
You may not even ask it, I will tell you all the same.
 First, do not ask about my life in the past tense, it still keeps flowing on.
I rolled its way as best as I could. Because of the spiral nature of the current, we can only go through multiple repetitions of what has been and will be.
</p><p>"What has been will be again," says the new translation of the Old Testament, and Vladimir Dahl in his dictionary recorded the same saying in normal, human, language – "radish is no sweeter than a horseradish".
But, if I may ask, do all those wisdom pieces helped a single anyone?
And when there comes the moment to feel that I don't care a f-f..er..fleck, I let it rip and go with the flow to the ultimate end.
</p><p>Life is predetermined like a winding mountain road with the drop-off on the right and the cliff-wall on the left, here you go along, repeating step by step the path passed before you, by you who was also "I".
Of course, when I recognize a repetition of familiar situations, I try to avoid ugly deeds for which I'll be  ashamed painfully.
And up till now I, like, have managed to dodge. Or?.
<br>Yes, like, haven't stepped...If only that bitter son of a bitch in my Chinese tent wouldn't unearth something else...
</p><p>So, here we are – I and the Varanda.
It goes to meet the Araks river and I am passing by and on, to the last limit beyond which there's the boundless blue sea and, probably, that, once lost, tiny sailing boat in it…
</p><p>Something again carries me off to all sorts of epochs with philologies.
But this is, after all, a private letter of a father to his daughter, and f-f..er..I mean, fairly didactic too, well...sort of...at certain passages…
Seems like it's a high time to wind up already.
</p><p class="centerd2 bold ital">...and then the morning of the following day came, and Scheherazade was suffered to live that day also...
</p><p>And about myself, dear daughter, I may report that the maxim "I know that I know nothing" is not applicable to me, though there were times when I also scattered this particular pearl.
Today, however, I have serious doubts about having even so tiny scraps of knowledge. I doubt that I know anything at all, be it even nothing.
</p><p>"We understand life only by looking back at the past," announced a lover of aphorisms.
</p><p>Asshole! You will not understand it even when pulled out of the grave and poked into it with your noseless skull!.
And no one will ever understand…
</p><p>There's just one thing beyond any doubt – life is shorter than even the dash between the dates of birth and death.
And I do not care that no one cares about my useless wisdom, because I know better than anyone else that after all that was there, after my stupidities and mistakes, after stepping in all sorts of shit, I am not a hair-breadth wiser, I am still the same naive sucker ready to get underway to the unseen Where-Where Mountains.
And let the hull is old like hell, the mast all cracks, and this whole nutshell will not survive the nearest storm – ahead, at full tilt!
And let another calypso or penelope (what's the difference?) tearing the blouse on her charms, cries out and rushes along the foamy water edge – full ahead!.
</p><p>I know that the bigger part of the dash is over so, come what may, the final leg would be passed as well, perk up – we’ll prick through for sure! Like hell will anything stop a hooey-pricker!.
</p><p>Good-bye, sweetie.
</p><p>My fatherly hug to you.
And, since you are fond of "You" in the plural –
</p><p>With love,
</p><p>your daddies: Sehrguey and Nikolayevich.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...and whichever rumors reach you, stay assured – we lived happily ever after and died on the same day...)
</p></div><p>P. S.:
in case you will give birth to a baby-son – look out! And if you notice an excessive interest for paper, or if instead of games in the computer he starts playing with text typing, then wrap him in a white cloth and throw into the fast-running river and he'll only say "thank you!" afterward.
</p><p>P. P. S.:
</p><p>I almost forgot to warn that any coincidence with the names of real persons is purely accidental and the described events – fictitious because there is no one responsible for the unpredictably weird dreams of a life-long graphomanic—
</p><p class="centered2">during the night of 20 to 21 August 2007,
</p><p class="centered3">on the left bank of the Varanda River... </p>
