<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>It’s not that I have any special knack for nosing out conspiracies, yet the unfaltering confluence of chance circumstances would always bring me straight to the spot of brewing a secret scheme…
</p><p>When in the kindergarten three boys of the senior group began to exchange clandestine hints, something like:
</p><p>“So it's today, eh?”
</p><p>“We’ll definitely go, yes?”
</p><p>“After the kindergarten, right?”
</p><p>I felt unbearable bitterness that some adventure was obviously underway while I stayed with the usual unchanging everyday.
</p><p>That's why I approached the leader of the three and asked him directly, “Where are you going to?”
</p><p>“To steal tomatoes in the Where-Where Mountains.”
</p><p>“May I go with you?”
</p><p>“Okay.”
</p><p>I had already had a vague idea that stealing was bad but in my whole life I hadn’t seen yet any mountains, only the low hillock of the Bugorok-Knoll near our Block, overgrown with fir trees and facing with its drop-off sandy side the grassy level grounds by the enclosure for garbage bins.
</p><p>However, first of anything else, I desired the wonderful tomatoes from the Where-Where Mountains. In my mind’s eye, I already could see their  glittering with solid red round ripe sides.
</p><p>So it was a whole day of waiting for the hour when adults start to come after their children, when I promptly declined going home with someone else’s mother, “No, thank you, I go with the boys to reach Block sooner.”

</p><p>The four of us went out of the gate but we didn’t take the short trail through the forest. Instead, we turned left to follow the wide dirt road on which there never appeared any vehicle.
 The road went uphill and then began to descent, and I kept looking out around and asking the same question about when the Where-Where Mountains would stand out.
 However, with the answers getting more and more curt and reluctant, I had to hold the eager question back, so as not to endanger my taking part in the tomato adventure.
</p><p>We went out to the road of concrete slabs whose junctions were filled with the black pitch. I knew that road descended from the Gorka blocks towards the House of Officers. We did not follow it though and only crossed into the thicket of supple bushes cut with a narrow trail which brought us to a house of gray logs with a sign hanging above its door for those who could read.
</p><p>The boys did not go any farther. They started aimlessly wander between the bushes and the washed-out gray of the logs in the house walls until an adult man came out of the door and angrily ordered us to go away.
</p><p>Our leader told him that he was sent by his parents to pick up the newspapers and mail, but the man grew even more angry, and I went home well taught what they mean by mentioning the Where-Where Mountains…
</p><p>Yet, I still believed that adventures and travels would certainly come my way and it’s better to be ready for them. That’s why, spotting a maverick box of matches upon the kitchen table, I grabbed it without a moment’s hesitation or delay: you have to train yourself to get the knack of vital arts, right?

</p><p>A couple of initial attempts proved that lighting a match against its box side was something easy indeed.
 And there at once popped up the urge to proudly demonstrate to someone my newly acquired skills.
</p><p>Who to? To Sasha and Natasha, sure thing, they would be much more impressed than Grandma. Besides, my authority by them called for repair and restoration after all the recent flops.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…however, this list of motives is made by me in hindsight, from the immeasurably distant future—my current present over this here fire loaded with potatoes to bake.
</p><p>But then, in that immeasurably distant past, without any philosophizing and logical justifications, I perfectly knew that…)
</p></div><p>I should call the younger ones to some hide-out and show them my apt control of the fire.
 The most suitable place was, of course, under the parents’ bed in their room, where we crawled in the Indian file.
</p><p>At the sight of matches in my hands Natasha oh-ohed in a whisper. Sasha kept silent and watched the process closely.
</p><p>The first match caught fire but went out too soon.
The second developed a good flame, yet all of a sudden it tilted close to the mesh of tulle bed cover hanging down by the wall. The narrow tip of the fire bent forward, the upturned icicle of yellow flame burst through the tulle forming a black, ever-widening, gap.
</p><p>For some time I looked at what was happening before I guessed the meaning and shouted to my brother and sister, “Fire! Run away! Fire!”
</p><p>But those little fools stayed where they were and only boohooed in duet.
</p><p>I got out from under the bed and ran across the landing to the Zimins’ where my Mom and Grandma were sitting in the kitchen of Paulinna Zimin drinking tea with her.
</p><p>On my skimble-skamble announcement of fire alarm, the three women rushed over the landing. I was the last to come to our apartment.
</p><p>Under the ceiling of the hallway, leisurely revolved the wisps of yellowish smoke.
The bedroom door stood open to show the half-meter-tall flames of fire in a merry dance upon the parents’ bed. The room was filled with a thin blue mist and somewhere within it, the twins were still howling.
</p><p>Grandma pulled the mattress and all from the bed down to the floor and stamped the fire with her slippers, repeating loud calls to her God. Mom yelled to Sasha and Natasha to get out from under the bed mesh.
</p><p>The fire jumped over onto the tulle curtain of the balcony door and Grandma pulled it down with her bare hands.
</p><p>In the kitchen, Paulinna Zimin rattled the saucepans in the sink filling them with water from the tap.
Mom took the twins to the children’s room, came running back, and told me to go over there too.
</p><p>We sat on the big sofa silent, heeding the to-and-fro racing in the corridor, uninterrupted swish of water from the tap in the kitchen, the stray exclamations of the women. What now?
</p><p>Then the noise little by little abated, the hallway door clicked behind departing auntie Paulinna. From the parents’ bedroom there came the sound of mop taps as during washing the floor; from time to time the splash of water poured down into the bowl was heard from the toilet room.
</p><p>The door opened. Mom stood there with a wide seaman belt in her hand. “Come here!” she called without giving any name, but the three of us knew perfectly well who was summoned.
</p><p>And then there reigned silence—some complete, suspended, silence...
I stood up and went to catch hell.
</p><p>We met in the middle of the room, under the silk shade from the ceiling. “Don’t you ever dare, you, piece of a rascal!” she said and swayed the belt.
</p><p>I cringed. The slap fell on the shoulder. It was just a slap, not a blow – no pain at all.
</p><p>Mom turned around and left.
</p><p>I was stunned by so light a punishment. It’s nothing compared to what I would surely get when Dad be home from work and see the bandaged hands of Grandma after applying vegetable oil to the burns…
</p><p>When the door clicked in the hallway and Dad’s voice said, “What the… er… What happened here?”, Mom hurried over there from the kitchen.
</p><p>All that she said was not heard but I made out these words, “I’ve already punished him, Kolya.”
</p><p>Dad went into the parents’ bedroom to estimate the damage and very soon entered our room. “Ew, you!” was all he told me.
</p><p>For a few days, the apartment had a strong smell of smoke. The runner from the parents’ bedroom was cut up into smaller pieces. The remnants of the tulle curtain and burned bed were taken out to the garbage enclosure across the road.
 </p><p>A couple of years later I could read already and whenever coming across a matchbox with the warning sticker: “Hide matches from children!”, I knew that that was about me too…</p>
