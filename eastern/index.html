<p>
In the dense dark of expiring night,   the darker, solid, blackness of the forest belt along the roadside  little by little began to show through.
</p><p>...for any vehicle, the road of this quality means the capital punishment with no chance of appealing to Philip Sober yet my shank's pony doesn’t mind...nothing will get you farther than a pair of good dogs...a walker makes five kilometers per hour, they taught us in school...by Uncle's estimation, the district center is in fifteen kilometers, no more...I started at a little past five, the bus to Moscow departs at nine...
 jingling gods! life's a delicious <em>havvage</em>!.
...especially with the favorable wind...
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">“ The wind blows right from behind<br>
what's on your mind?<br>
The sailing will be plain<br>
to fetch a bottle of Portwein...”
</p><p>...slow down, little one, don’t rush when cutting corners...the dry law is vigilantly lurking, mind the Prohibition... Dura lex, sed lex… wanna a translation?.
</p><p>...don't you worry, buddy, Latin is a bro from the home neighborhood...
</p><p>...yet the vulgarity! the baseness of the subject: "portwein", "a bottle", flat as a pancake...
</p><p>...then what?..show respect to the art of hammerers...a folklore item...next to iambic...
</p><p>...no iambi-zombie talk, private...or we'll have you rotten with fatigues at dactyl...
</p><p>...ha!.. who're you?..a self-taught good for nothing...screw up your loose screw first...a gourmand with fluffy chopsticks... "ah, iambus is not yummy! may I have some choree with a sprinkle of trochee, please?”...how about grayling under sherry then?...
</p><p>...hmm, yes...the chorees are dying out...fucked, in fact, by the hostile ecology...arid vistas are closing in – 'warmly approving the saved reserves we will hold aloof the initiative of the plan in excess replete with the deepest satisfaction ahead of time by centners of running meters from a hectare of rolled metal'...feel free to start up the red book for all the elegant belles-lettres...doomed darlings...not a chance for survival...the golden days of muses gulped down by the abyss of past...
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"The wrath sing, goddess, of the Peleus' son, Achilles..."
</p><p>...this single line of hexameter calls for two square meters of footnotes so that the folks suckled and brought up with the editorials from Central Press would get it what exactly that fucker Achilles wants of the Brazilian football star's kid...but think of the paper deficit!..we need it for printing about the growth of wealth and well-being!.
 </p><p>...you know the truth: if you want to live but there is no one to live with, you have to live with anyone you come across...that's why folks adore folklore...the perfection itself, mind you, can be found among those handcrafted items...here, for your consideration:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"Who of you, bastards, dared label God a rasp?!."
</p><p>In the dark, already slightly graying, over the deserted road sounded a snort of a restrained chuckle. The black clot of a tree floated up along the roadside and fell back.
</p><p>...yeah, they did school you to toe the line...who's around here to look back at your causeless laugh?...
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"I walk, and I keep smiling to myself<br>
and at the thought 'what would they think of me?'<br>
I into laughter burst..."
</p><p>...another piece crafted in the neighborhood?...
</p><p>...no, it's by some Czech with a tilt towards poetry...
</p><p>...you mean, Czechs are not homies?..I'll have your throat cut!...
</p><p>...have mercy, oh, Abraham!..check in the bush maybe we'll square up with Yahweh and keep your son unscratched...
</p><p>...and if I am Taras Bulba?...
</p><p>...oh, yes!..in the dried form, pressed for the herbariums...Robinson Crusoe's goat is more of a Cossack than you...drop your bragging before it chocked and killed with laughter the nighbor's nanny-goat ...
</p><p>...not a chance...they say that laughter is the sovereign property of Khoma Sapiensoff...
</p><p>...well, from the standpoint of physiology all is radiant clear – spasms and coughs tremendously benign to health, but how to grasp it from the significance's point of view?...
</p><p>...I love challenger kids, yes I do!..let's have a look...where are the decent people laughing?..right, in the  places specifically designated for the purpose...that’s where you have to look for an answer...like, in the circus or, say...
</p><p>...hurray!..to the movies, we are going!..that's some comedy!... Fantozzi, what a good fellow!..wow!..knows his trade!...
</p><p>Bang! Ding! Plop! Chink! Pisssssss...
</p><p>Glee and guffaw, giggling, laughter beyond all the limits and past all the bounds.
</p><p>Boo-ooh-ha! Ha-ho-ho! Gu-gu-hu! Wu-hu-hu!
</p><p>And only my neighbor to the left, a lady of immense proportions, sits listless, silent.
Why? Dozed off or what? No, dutifully gazes at the silver screen, without yielding any reaction though.
</p><p>The man in there does his best to turn her on, he takes a run to hit his head against the lamppost.
 The hall reported with a happy volley...
And she? Good news she's not yawning.
</p><p>But what's that? Unbelievable! At a minor episode, where Fantozzi, after another fall, plop, splash, whizz, changes in a suit five times bigger his size and the public almost do not react, exhausted in the previous convulsions, that's when from the exorbitant volumes of my neighbor rolls out the laughter of the same dimensions.
Well done, comedian! But how do you start her?
</p><p>...and now, when asked: why do people laugh?..my answer is – because of fear...
</p><p>...fear?!..
</p><p>...exactly!..you can’t put your finger on anything more dreadful for a woman than uglifying clothes...
while, when the comedian's bicycle lost its saddle on the run and the zanny landed with his asshole onto the pipe that stayed sticking up there, the hall was shaking with the males' guffaw... a lady, naturally, can weather by such a trifle...
</p><p>...laughter from fear!..nonsense!..they do not laugh but flee when scared...besides, your arguments are based on laughter of the basest sort...and people laugh because of not only that someone stumbled-slipped-sprawled-fell-into-the-drains, they laugh at witticisms as well...then, there are still epigrams...there's a hell of lots of ways to have a hearty laugh...
</p><p>...verily, verily, I say unto you!..laughter comes from fear and is both request and prayer begging Unknown to avert the thing they laugh at, to keep it off the prayer sayer, I mean, off them who’s splitting their sides...and same exactly foundation underlies the laughter caused by the finest witticisms...where "ha-ha-ha" means: "let me never be a target of such a joke!"...while laughing at oneself is just a prayer: "let I never again step into it!"...they are inseparable Siamese – fear and laughter...tell me what you laugh at and I'll tell what you are afraid of!...
</p><p>...so, Fool, you mean to say that someone who never laughs, is not afraid of anything?.
</p><p>...Your Majesty!..we are not considering abnormal anomalies, the subject at hand is a representative of the class of vertebrates, the subclass of mammals, the species of primates, the subspecies of anthropoid with the Latin name "homo sapiens."..so don't f-f..er..fret our brains, please...
</p><p>...but look, then it means that by means of a joke you can find out...
</p><p>...aha!..beginning to get it?..excellent!..on we go!..and here, by the way, a kilometer post...
...what does it tell?..no, I can't make out, it's still dark.
</p><p>...well, to hell!..let it be...it's not the first neither the last...stop molesting orphan ones!..do you need it? yomp your way...
</p><p>Oh, I'm sorry. No crooked tricks or dirty intent, I swear. Once again, please, forgive. Have a nice stay!
</p><p>...hmm...so, what were we about?..ah, well, of course!..considering the immortal question histed by the classic: "What are you laughing at?"...the answer is: at something that we fear to learn firsthand...what is the forerunner of laughter?..that's right – a smile...and what is the smile?..right once again – the show of teeth...let's say, we meet each other at the lowest rungs of the evolutionary ladder, where I can’t see what kind of stegosaurus you are, and you suspect me of being lungfishy...at that uneducated period, we roamed without passports...now, we meet and – first and foremost – what?..that's right!..we bare our teeth, like, look what I have, in case of you allow yourself excessive liberties...see, where all these laugh-hiccups and giggle-spasms spring from?...boiled down to its elementary basis, laughter is a means of self-defense with a Hegelian dual function – to shoo away and carry favor (2 in 1)...it is used, however, not in case of real danger (it's not the right time for giggling) but when the threat is an imaginary one...they don’t use it in absence of threat, or imagination, or when there is nothing to protect...using its monopoly on the gizmo under our consideration, the man climbed up to the top of the mentioned ladder up to the level where they issue passports and enroll you, if so is your wish, to gyms to learn kickboxing...Amen...
</p><p>...wow!..it's time to shout "eureka!" and jog off to the patent office...
</p><p>...why, silly sweetheart?..it's been a long time since all the wheels were reinvented...any supernova idea was brewing more than once in brains of a Chaldean priest, or a Greek sophist, a medieval alchemist, an Aztec knot-tier, a prophetic Brahman, or a Tibetan sage...all discoveries and uber-super ideas are nothing more than using other words or symbols for the same truths old as the hills...invariable, as the change of seasons, or phases of the moon, of day and night rotation...every day is new and unique, every day is a repetition of myriad of lots of exactly same days...
</p><p>...you know how to wrap it nicely, smart Alec...yet, there's a question from the audience: did you fix the shit firm enough, citizen?...
</p><p>...sit tight, marijuanisto!..no chance you tear it off unless you’ve got some hugely "bitter but" up your sleeve, or have you?...
</p><p>...uh-oh, alas, but, yes, Your I-ness...where–in the scintillating shebang of yours–would you place the smile of a two-month-old baby?..what is it afraid of, when smiling to its mother, or nenka, or mutter, or whatever?..that toothless smile seems to flush all you mental juggle-schmuggle straight down the drain...ain't it, Mr. Brilliant Kid?.</p>
