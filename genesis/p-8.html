<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Genesis<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The WWII was burning out yet didn't ceased devouring the cannon fodder as quenchlessly as always. Kolya, a youth from a Ryazan village, and lots of other youths from other places were outfitted with the   striped Navy vests under black pea-jackets and kept for a couple of months at a recruit depot to get drilled military basics and know “Attention!” from “Dismissed!” They also were taught to distinguish the bayonet of a rifle from its trigger and, finally, put on high-speed cutters for a landing operation somewhere up the Danube river in Austria.
</p><p>But, for all the speed of the landing operation cutters, they didn’t get there in time because the fascist Germany had just capitulated and there was no one to attack.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…long ago I secretly regretted at this point: eew! they left no time for my Dad to become a hero!
Now, on the contrary, I'm glad that he never shot and killed anyone, not even accidentally…)
</p></div><p>Then he was charged with guarding the empty Serpent Island off the coast of Bulgaria, or maybe Romania, from where they transferred him to a minesweeper, a minuscule Naval trawler with a tiny crew.
</p><p>My Dad’s seafaring service began with the passage from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk over the ruff Black Sea; it was not a full-blown storm but the sea was pretty choppy...
 Riding a swing in the park is fun but if you go on enjoying it for a couple of hours the stomach will throw up anything stuck in it from the day before yesterday’s breakfast. That sea crossing continued much longer…
</p><p>When Red Navy man Ogoltsoff came ashore at the port of destination, even the land itself kept swaying under his feet. He tried to puke between the tall timber-stacks lined along the pier, but to no avail.
 The young sailor sat down just where he stood and, watching the towering rows of timber that kept swaying up and down, decided that he'd inescapably die in that naval service…
</p><div id="span"><p>(…you may easily figure it out that was a wrong assumption as long as he had not yet met your grandmother, nor persuaded her to go with him to ZAGS.
 And your grandmother hadn’t yet born three children without becoming a single mother, which constitutes an unprecedented instance in this story under way…)
</p></div><p>So, seasickness did not kill my father. He learned to endure the pitching and tossing. He tattooed a blue anchor on the back of his left hand, and on his right arm a swift outline of a swallow in the flight—from the elbow to the wrist—pinching with his beak a tiny letter envelope  (“fly with greetings…”); and  he furrowed on his bitty minesweeper the vast expanses of the Black Sea, clearing it from the minefields what, actually, minesweepers are designed for.
</p><p>The main difference of naval mines with their land counterparts is that the sea species must be tethered or else they would scatter drifting astray to destroy any ship met on the way without checking whether she was  “theirs” or “ours”. That’s why a cocked up sea mine is fixed with a steel cable to an anchor
 that grabs at the seabed. The mines—iron balloons filled with air and TNT—soar up in the water not reaching the surface though restricted by the cable length correlated to the depth on the sea route dealt with. And there the naval mines hover, some two or three meters deep, waiting for a passing ship to catch one of the spike-like detonators stuck out of the mine-shell in different directions as in a babyish sketch of the sun.
</p><p>Thanks to its shallow immersion, the Navy minesweeper passes over the minefield without hitting detonator spikes. The long loop of thick steel cable is dragged by the boat in its wake to cut the mines anchorage at the seabed and let the mines pop up to the surface and get destroyed. For that end a manned rowboat leaves the minesweeper heading towards the mine. The team's task is to fix a dynamite cartridge with the Bickford fuse onto the huge iron ball of the mine. (Which is performed not in a placid park pond but midst unsteady waves in the open sea with the mine's spheric side heaving up above the rowboat and then falling under it, striving to ram with the horn of a detonator.)
</p><p>The final step is done by the boatswain seated in the rear seat, with a lit cigarette between his lips meant not to show off his daredevilry but as a tool readied to ignite the fuse. Now it’s set on fire and – Hup! Hup! Ho!
Everyone pulls with might and main, no shirkers in the boat. It’s of vital importance to get away as far  as possible while the fuse is hissing behind because the charge of powerful explosives within a naval mine has to tear up the hulls of line battleships…
</p><p>When broke down into constitutive elements, romantic heroism just disappears and maritime mine clearance starts to resemble the prosaic job of a tractor bumbling in a kolkhoz field. The minesweeper gets to the assigned water area and furrows it all day long, back and forth, with the cable released behind the stern; and on the following day – to the next area. On the whole, the minesweeper crew’s heroism consists in being a good team, and the fact that my father stayed alive resulted from their candid cooperation.
</p><p>For example, at the end of a typical working day, Nikolai Ogoltsoff watched over the stern winch when he noticed a mine approaching the boat because the mine anchorage line got intertwined with the minesweeper’s trailing cable reeled back to the windlass drum.
 </p><p>It was too late to switch off the winch which would spin on by inertia for a short, yet sufficient, time to drag and bang the mine against the boat.
Dad’s shirt stood off away from his body like the hide of a beast at the moment of utmost danger, and he roared, “Full Ahead!”, with such an animal force that Captain on the bridge lightning-haste duplicated his order on E. O. T. sending the bell to the engine room, the mechanic, Dad’s shift-man, did his job quickly, the boat propeller churned up the wave whose pressure pushed the nearing mine off. So the team saved each other.
</p><p>Five years later there remained no unswept areas in the sea routes and my father was transferred from the minesweeper to a coastguard ship, again in charge of the diesel engine. The following year saw the end of his second term in the Navy service and they offered my father a job in a “mailbox”.
</p><p>At those times the USSR had lots of secret institutions, secret factories, and even secret cities, none of which had an ordinary postal address so as to fool enemy spies and leave them clueless about all those secret objects location. As a result, the addressee stopped living in any street or city, he lived in no region neither district and he was referred to in a much shorter way: “N. Ogoltsoff, Mail Box №***.”
</p><p>Since on his last furlough before the demobilization,  Red Navy man Ogoltsoff N. M. registered his marriage with Citizen Vakimova G. J. she landed up at the same “mailbox” in the Carpathian mountains.
</p><p>The “box” was not fixed up with a maternity hospital and for bringing me forth my mother had to visit the town of Nadveerna, thirty kilometers from the regional center, the city of Stanislavl (later renamed into Ivano-Frankivsk). Going out the "box" gave her the frightful jitters because the Bandera men were shooting at the vehicles on the roads.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…the bigger part of my life I considered the Bandera men bloody bandits and Nazi accomplices. What else to think of them if a full-scale military division named “Galichina” was manned with Western Ukrainians to fight against the Red Army?
Then, gradually, it dawned on me that two years before the German invasion it was the Red Army who occupied Western Ukraine and assisted the Soviet secret police, aka NKVD, in executions and deportation of potential opponents to the Soviet system.
</p><p>Besides, what is a division when compared to an army? Among the German Wehrmacht’s comrades-in-arms, there also was the Russian Liberation Army (RLA) of almost one million servicemen fighting against the USSR.
</p><p>And last but not least, the rank-and-file Red Army men, participants in the events of that period, let me know that the Bandera men fought fiercely against both Soviet and German troops. They were Carpathian guerrillas defending their land against successive liberators, aka enslavers.
</p><p>Still, my parents all their life long considered the Bandera men savage bandits…)
</p></div><p>And even two years later, when my mother was once again in need of going to the maternity hospital, the dogged machine-gun rounds  still rumbled on the slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, but she could not hear them anymore because her husband had been transferred from one “mailbox” to another and left the Transcarpathia for the Valdai Upland…
</p><p>The change in the life circumstances of my parents resulted from a snitch-on letter sent to the Special Division of the previous “mailbox” from Konotop. It was composed by the people living in the same house with Galina Vakimova before her marriage.
</p><p>The house (in Konotop parlance <em>“<em>khutta</em>”</em>) of 12 by 12 meters was a divided property, half of which belonged to citizen Ignat Pilluta. The other half was equally divided between citizen Katerina Vakimova with her children and citizens Duzenko with their daughter, so each of the  two mentioned families owned an entrance hall, a kitchen, and a room.
</p><p>The daughter of citizens Duzenko married citizen Starikov who moved into her father’s part of the <em>khutta</em>. One kitchen and one room turned not enough for accommodating both the young family and the in-laws.
In order to increase their living space, Duzenko and Starikov learned the number of the mailbox whereto the demobilized Mariner took their former neighbor and wrote to the Special Division of the “box” their snitch-on letter to inform  SD, whose foremost duty was catching spies, that the father of Galina Vakimova (presently Ogoltsova) was arrested by the NKVD before the war but five years later he somehow managed to return to Ukraine.
<br>Besides, in the years of German occupation, his house served the headquarters of the German troops. (Which was true in part, a Wehrmacht company headquarters was stationed in the Pilluta’s half of the <em>khatta</em>.) And with the approach of the Soviet Army, Joseph Vakimov fled together with the retreating fascists.
</p><p>The informers knew that Special divisions of “mailboxes” were especially vigilant and merciless, so the relatives of Joseph, who treasonously disappeared in so glaring anti-Soviet way, would certainly be arrested and, at least, deported.
</p><p>Too bad, in their, otherwise quite logical calculations, they neglected the time factor. Namely, by that moment Great Leader and Teacher of Peoples, Comrade Stalin, rested in peace already. The nuts tightened under his rule to the utmost started to gradually let up.
</p><p>Of course, Nikolai Ogoltsoff was repeatedly interrogated in SD of the “mailbox”. There took place an exchange of official correspondence between the “box’s” Special Division and the Division of Interior Affairs of the city of Konotop.
</p><p>However, my father was not repressed thanks to his absolutely peasant origin, as well as to the fact that diesel engines generating electricity in “mailboxes” obeyed him so willingly.
</p><p>Still and all, there was no way to simply blink at the informants' “signal”  and, just in case, they transferred my father to another “mailbox”, located far from borders with foreign countries…
