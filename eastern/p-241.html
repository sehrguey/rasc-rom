 <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
     <p>
It's dawning. Murky-gray ceiling of dissolving darkness overhead got propped by the endless walls of hazy trunks alongside both roadsides, veiled with a mesh of hunger-black branches and chance twigs still bearing haphazard spots of withered leaves.
Along the shredded asphalt, the comets of tiny snow specks  are scuttling, swaying, drifting off their orbits, whirling their thinned streams of dry powder snow.
</p><p>The wind is favorable. From behind. So blow, buddy, blow! Not a chance you ever pierce the padded jacket presented by my aunt. The head in the tight-knitted "cock" hat, warm socks on the feet in  the sturdy likes of army boots.
The road under the current of whipped-up snow streams stretches to the horizon to merge with infinity...
Blow, the curly one! The ancient Greeks found it out, sounding flute makes the march easier.
Sturdy rig, firm trail, what else would you want for to be happy?
</p><p>A cleft in the forest belt let a country road fork off. Through the gap, there peeped a surprised field: who's so happy here?
And because of that field, and of that make-believe road ahead, and because of so grim morning with the pale-transparent streams of white snow scudding on under the wind, a sudden jubilant delight and silly joy rushed welling up the throat to splash out a cry into the confused desert around, "I! Am! Happy!"
The snow streams whisked up along the asphalt kept silent, reflecting, like a mirror, the whirlwind spirals in the clouds galloping so low overhead.
</p><p>"Am! Happy!" This time,  somehow with a threat and as if inquiringly.
</p><p>"Happy!" That one sounded already sad.
</p><p>...yes...the music played but shortly...where are you, happiness?..only in the past or in the future...some elusive illusion...
</p><p>...and when coming across its tiny speck I'm always alone...why so?..it even hurts somehow...now, if she were by...though she needs no hiking marches...or if she watched on a screen, in a dream, anywhere – this very morning, and this crippled road, a solitary traveler along...
</p><p>...dumb moron!..will you ever get it?..stupid wretch!..there is no "she" at all but only your driveling indistinct dreams unclear even to the dreaming fool...dreams of an impossible conjunction of heavenly beauty and  passion for pleasures of quite earthly nature, a non-existant combination of cold-sharp mind and fervently clinging quim that craves for you only...shut your lusty gape, kiddo...you've built a bridge atop a mountain and keep a-waiting for a river to run under...and besides, to get some anything you need to give some kind of something...and what, with your kind permission, do you have to offer?..this dapper dandy padded jacket?..wow!..yes, some heavy-duty rig...and being worn for just a week, no longer...what?..there's even money on you?..fifty rubles?!..but that's a jackpot!..now, subtract the tenner for a bus ticket, then twenty-five for the flight to Kiev, and the fiver for the local train...and keep in mind the <em>havvage</em> expenses...now, give me one good reason for expecting tender love and crazy passion?...
</p><p>...castes are divided by the abyss unbridgeable...who do you pull for?...where d’you belong?... what are you: a master or a slave?…
</p><p>...I am what I am what I am at the fifth bottom after the ninth gate...your ’master’ trap is a too shallow approach, everybody has at least three masters – Stomach, Genitals, and Brain...the deeper you dig the more of them spring out which one to serve?…so could you get off my back, please?.
</p><p>...show proper respect to der Heilige Arthur’s teaching, infidel...he sez we cannot change ourselves, we’re only capable of getting to know us a tad bit better, and it’s me who widens your horizons, pal, be grateful to your constant second...or, mayhap, you wanna swap our ordinal numbers?.
</p><p>...cut out this empty ding-dong, you knows yoursel – the first to wake up retains the slippers all day long so there’s no use to shuffle kings, and cabbage, and walruses, and carpenters...
</p><p>...to saddle then! and back to your trinity of Masters...if only you don’t want to look for a suitable outsider, Genosse Feldzug-Führer...
</p><p>...shut up with your red herring!…any raccoon at the Central Committee axiomatically slaves for his stomach...to be a slave’s slave?...count me out! I do not care for his stomach...neither for fucking dialectics with all due respect to imbibed Socrates…
</p><p>...but then what else to busy me with? I cannot do a better job than my legs…
</p><p>...enough! no more quibbling!...say it in plain words – are you a master or a slave?…
</p><p>...damn! you are a nail-hard customer...okay, I am the master of my dick if it will make you happy…
</p><p>...great!...that makes 33 % plus… you're cooking on gas, bro!...so on we go, would you devour your neighbor at the demand of your empty stomach?…
</p><p>...I don’t think so…
</p><p>...yes or no, sweetie?...
</p><p>...no!...fuck you!…
</p><p>...good boy! now, I see myself whom I’ve loved so much...and, by the by, you’re at level 66 % plus...now, to disentangle the remainder of the Gordian lacework…
</p><p>...but I don’t remember what we were about…
</p><p>...stop your zigzagging!...it’s master or slave choice...who rules who, you know…
</p><p>...oh!...I’m more tired than my legs already...well, as long as my system is kept in check by means of…
</p><p>...enough!...no more words!...”means of” is nothing but an instrument...congrats, Mr. Master-unto-Yoursel...two words of warning though...don’t stick your neck out nor try to change the world because a revolutionary without a supporting party is as ridiculous as a stateless citizen...and if I were you I wouldn’t kick up much sing and dance about God’s being dead 'cause all we need is Master giving us commands...but let’s peep out into the wide wild world...what are you personnaly out there?…
</p><p>...I have no slaves!...nor need any…
</p><p>...easy, corner-cutter...a slave owner is someone else’s slave in 99 % plus...and you know as well as I do that having none does not exempt you...so, whose one are you?... Maugham’s?... John Mill’s?…
</p><p>...yes, yes, yes!...as well as of that topless nuts who popped up above the fence in the Area...I am a slave to all and everything, yet temporarily, until my expiration date or simply getting bored…
</p><p>...seems like we’ve run into another vicious circle with no chance to be resolved at the round table in m/u 41769’s stoker house, sorry for interrupting your trudge...wipe your snots and just keep walking...some business you're a specialist in…
</p><p>And he walked, stepping on the tails of the transparent bands of scampering grains of snow.
Each step was no different from the previous one, none of the steps changed a jot of the road, and neither the low leaden sky, nor the walls of forest belts on both sides got changed in any way.
</p><p>...all and the same...that same all...everything moves to stays the same…
</p><p>Occasionally, a concrete kilometer post with figures in a blue squarelet of tin approached gradually to fall behind.
A few hours of such uninterrupted walking, even without any load, and the ache, slight but nagging, would seep into the shoulder bones. He knew that.
But not on that day. The district center was at most fifteen kilometers from the village, as said by his uncle. And from the town there started the transport services of a developed civilization...
</p><p>Something loomed at a distance on the roadside; some huge object.
Fixing his gaze on that motionless strangeness midst the general chaotic stir, he was nearing it, trying to guess from afar: what could it be?
</p><p>...some machinery...aha...and what kind of it?...
</p><p>...who knows, they're tinkling out lots of them for agriculture...let's get closer and then…
</p><p>A weeny burning sensation broke up in his bladder.
</p><p>...would you but wait a bit with your urges?..yes, machinery, yet from another sphere…
</p><p>He stopped by a tangerine-yellow road roller.
</p><p>...how could you possibly get to it, poor thing?..feels chilly, eh?..no doubt...way too accustomed to asphalt tropics...bituminous heat and stuff...what are your plans for to survive the wither?..no escape to warmer countries, too heavy on the rise, besides, it's too late...and no tool to dig a furrow for yourself, not your specialization...anabiosis remains the only chance, buddy ...freeze into the surrounding environment like them those cold-blood earth-water animals...though not a bed of roses too…
</p><p>He poured his empathy out onto the scattering of small-sized gravel, then zipped the fly up and stepped over the uneven dark spot on the road, which a couple of hours before was tea prepared by Uncle's wife for a meal.
</p><p>...everything flows, everything changes...one and the same tea can’t be poured out twice…
</p><p>It was his second visit to the village where he was now walking from.
The first time though he did not come himself but was brought by his Dad.
The days of that summer lasted forever, unhurried, like the slow stream dividing the village into ‘ours’ and ‘theirs’.
The knee-deep water in the quiet creek was rolling soundlessly along the sandy bottom. A little bit upstream you got into the green-shaded tunnel in between the walls of dense willow thicket. Whitebait brushed ticklishly against the shanks. It feels creepy, especially when you are twelve and they told you some scary stories about leeches and "horsehair".
</p><p>And beyond the village, quite at a distance, maybe at an hour's walk, there was the river Mostya not too wide but enough for a swim. And he was swimming to the opposite bright grassy  bank and pushing the red-and-blue ball ahead over the water, watching the light spot of his face reflected in the wet, spinning, sides of the ball.
Or was that ball and the green bank by some other river of his childhood?
Yet, the fact remained that he entered the Mostya river as well. Twenty years before…
</p><p>Twenty years later, on his second visit, he did not enter it. It was too cold for swimming. Late autumn. Emptiness reigned in the wide sway of the fields. Empty was the village with small hillocks of crushed bricks – ruins of houses overgrown with rank grass. “Khan Mamai's horde was here”.
The remaining huts were silent, squatting lowly as if pressed down by the ocean of  faded sky. At the bottom of the Marianas Trench.
</p><p>"Looking for whom?"
</p><p>"Sehrguey Mikhailovich Ogoltsoff."
</p><p>"And who are you?"
</p><p>"Sehguey Ogoltsoff."
</p><p>"So, the nephew?" guessed she quickly.
</p><p>"Exactly," he agreed, holding back a smile.
</p><p>She invited to go over into the room and was sorry that the uncle had just left for work after the midday break, and she didn’t forget to praise the scrawny cat thoroughly washing his face all the morning to predict arrival of guests. Then she returned to the kitchen with the large Russian oven and slow ticking of the weight-driven clock in the wall, to the table covered with worn-out oil-cloth above the plywood doors in its box, to the persistent stares from the silent crowd of differently sized photos in the corner between two windows.
</p><p>He sat leaning against the backrest of the couch, beneath a narrow arched window to the front garden, checking the interior of a single room with a brick stove opposite his feet, from which a smooth gray pipe of asbestos-concrete rose up and by the ceiling veered to the kitchen wall.
</p><p>Next to the stove, stood a broad bed with paint-coated legs and sides, carrying a pyramidal tower of cushions next to the plush carpet pinned up by  small nails over the wall, in which, on some of the thousand-and-one nights, the young man abducted a bashful beauty on his plush stallion, and his accomplice followed them, with a parting glance over his shoulder at the minarets in the sleeping city. In the corner of the room, a brown wardrobe was waiting for their arrival.
</p><p>On this side, next to the couch, stood a table beneath the second of the arched windows, with chairs pushed under it and, by the blank wall to the neighbors', a television set on a high shelf.
</p><p>From under the TV to the kitchen door a rug-mat stretched, following the directions of the planks in the ceiling overhead, naked and blue...
She tinkled plates washing up in the kitchen, occasionally coming to the door of the room to ask if his parents were healthy, and where he worked, and what's his job.
By the cautiousness of the questions, he got it that she knew.
As if it could be otherwise. His father, since retired, was visiting his native village almost every summer, bringing along his granddaughter too. He surely shared his troubles with his brother.
</p><p>The kitchen’s entrance door banged, "Grandma! Two fives!"
</p><p>"You’re back?" responded she with tender strictness. "Take off your jacket. And do not shuffle that way. Go say 'hello' to the uncle, (to the whispered question) your mom's cousin."
</p><p>From behind the door handle, the boy's face with a strand of hair sticking up in a cow-lick above the right corner of the steep forehead slowly peeped in, with the childishly serious look.
</p><p>After a prolonged "hello-oo" he disappeared to go on with the inaudible questioning of his grandmother.
</p><p>"Lenochka's dad," answered she laying the table. "Remember her staying at grandma Sasha's last summer?"</p>
