<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The first notch in my memory dividing my legendary past from the  records of life events in my personal recollections  was drawn by the morning sun whose raw glare made me squint and keep turning my face sideways when I stood atop a small grassy mound, upon which Mom had pulled me to give way to a crowd of men in black marching across our route to the kindergarten.
</p><p>From the mass of their advancing column, they yelled to me their cheerful ‘hellos’ and holding Mom’s hand, I felt big, pleased, and proud that my name's so popular among the adult convict-<em>zeks.</em>
 I never realized then that the amiable attention of  <em>zeks </em>on their march resulted from the presence of so young and  good-looking mother…
</p><p>The <em>zeks</em> were building two blocks of two-story apartment houses upon a hill hight Gorka, and after the first block was accomplished, our large family moved into a two-room apartment on the upper, second, floor in an eight-apartment house.
</p><p>All in all, our Block comprised six two-story houses alongside the perimeter of a vast rectangular courtyard. All of the six houses were entered from the courtyard, four longer cranked buildings bounded its corners and had three entrances each, while the two shorter houses, inserted in the long sides of the rectangular, had only one.
 </p><p>The road of hard concrete ran around Block separating it from its twin block under construction, which mirrored ours in every detail.
 Let out to play in the courtyard, I often crossed the road and went to the construction site.
 <em>Zeks</em> working there never daunted me and at the midday breaks, they shared with me their <em>balanda</em> soup.
</p><p>Thanks to the exorbitant growth of specific expressions that popped up to embellish my, otherwise babyish, talk, my parents promptly figured out who were my current gossip milieu and posthaste entered me to the kindergarten.
</p><p>When the second block on the Gorka was completed, <em>zeks</em> disappeared altogether and all the subsequent construction works at the Object (people around preferred this name to “Mailbox”) were performed by the soldiers with black shoulder straps in their uniform – blackstrappers. Apart from them, there also were redstrapper soldiers at the Object, but as for their mission there I am not aware of up to now…
</p><p>The hill of the Gorka, the highest part in the Object, shared its name with the two blocks built atop of it. Across the ring road bordering the Gorka blocks there grew the forest, on all the four, but no tree could ever make it over the concrete of the roadway…
</p><p>The trail to the kindergarten started right behind our house. There was a straight long tilt towards the gate in the fence of Recruit Depot Barracks. Yet before you reached it, a wide path branched off into the pine forest on the right.
After bypassing the fenced barracks and a large black pond under big trees, the path went down through the thicket of young fir trees. The descent ended at the fence of planks midst the forest, and in a wide clearing there stood a two-story house among the mesh of narrow paths and playgrounds with sandboxes and small teremok-huts made of wood.
There even stood a real nosy bus. It had no wheels, to make it easy to step inside directly from the ground, but the steering wheel and the seats were all in place.

</p><p>Coming to the kindergarten, you had to take off your coat and shoes, leave them in your narrow, tall locker with the picture of two cherries on the door and, after changing into slippers, you might climb the stairs to the second floor with big rooms for separate groups and the even bigger, common, dining room.
  </p><p>My kindergarten life was a patchwork of various feelings and sensations.
 The feel of victory in the noisy locker-room because the parents already started coming after their children where, prompted by Mom, I discovered my ability to tie my shoelaces myself, without anyone’s help...
 The bitterness of humiliating defeat by those same shoelaces on that morning when they happened pulled tight into wet intractable knots and my Mom had to untangle them, distressed that she would be late for her work…
</p><p>In the kindergarten, you never know what awaits you there before Mom, or Dad or some neighbor woman will come to take you home.
</p><p>They can insert a glistening tube-end of a thin rubber hose deep into your nostril and blow in a nasty tasting powder, or else make you drink a whole tablespoon of pesky fish oil, “Come on! It’s so good for health!”
</p><p>The most horrible thing when they announce that it is the injection day today.
 The children will line up towards the table with a loudly clinking steely box on it from where the nurse takes out the replaceable needles for her syringe.
 The closer to the table the tighter you are squeezed with horror. You envy the lucky ones for whom the procedure is already over and they go away from the table pressing a piece of cotton wool to their forearm and boast happily it didn’t hurt. No, not a tad bit!.
The children in the line around whisper how good it is that today’s injection is not done under the shoulder blade. That’s the most fearful one…
</p><p>Saturdays are the best. In addition to the usual dinner of hateful bean soup, they give you half-glass of sour cream sprinkled with sugar.
 And they do not send the children to bed for the “quiet hour”. Instead, they hang dark blankets over the dining room windows and show filmstrips on the wall.
 The caretaker reads the white lines of inscription beneath each frame and asks if everyone has reviewed everything in the picture, before she drags the next frame in where Zhelezniak the Seaman will capture the armored train of the Whites or a rusty nail will become a brand new one after his visit to the steel furnace, depending on which of the filmstrips the projector was loaded with.
</p><p>Those Saturday happenings fascinated me: a voice sounding from the darkness sliced with the thin rays seeping out the slits in the projector’s tin side, the pictures slowly changing each other on the wall brought about a touch of mysterious secrecy…
</p><p>I seemed to rather like the kindergarten than otherwise, even with certain hidden reefs lying in wait there for me to run into.
 One of such skulkers trapped me after Dad repaired an alarm clock at home and, handing it back to Mom, he said, “Here you are!. You owe me a bottle now.” Which words, for some reason, delighted me so dearly that I boasted of them in front of children in my kindergarten group which braggadocio was reported by the caretaker to my Mom when she came to take my home in the evening.
</p><p>On our way home, Mom said I did a shameful thing because a boy should not share outside home everything that goes on among the family. Now, they might think that my Dad was an alcoholic. Was it what I wish? Eh? Was that so very nice?
</p><p>How I hated myself at that moment!.
</p><p>And it was in the kindergarten that for the first time in my life, I fell in love. However, I did my level best to hold the feeling back. With bitter sadness, I understood how useless was that love because of the insurmountable—like a bottomless abyss—difference in age between me and the swarthy girl of dark eyes with a cherry-berry gleam in them. She was two years younger…
</p><p>But how unreachable and adult looked the former kindergarten girls who came on a visit there after their first day at school. Clad in festive white aprons, putting on so reserved and mannerly airs, they scarcely deigned to answer the eager questions asked by our group’s caretaker.
</p><p>The caretakers and other workers at the kindergarten wore white robes, however, not always all of them. Anyway, not that one who once got seated next to me on a bench allaying my distress. It’s hard to say what exactly it was – a fresh scratch on my knee or a new bump on my forehead, yet as for her name, it was positively Zeena.
</p><p>Her gentle palm was petting my head, and I forgot to cry with my cheek and temple pressed to her left breast. The other cheek and closed eyelids felt the warmth of the sun, I listened to the thuds of her heart beneath the green dress that smelt of summer until there came a shrill call from the building, “Zeena!.”
</p><p>And at home, we had Grandmother who came from Ryazan because Mom started going to work and there should be someone to look after Sasha and Natasha.
</p><p>Grandma Martha wore a cotton blouse over a straight skirt almost to the floor and a white blue-dotted kerchief on her head whose large square she folded into a big triangle to cover her hair and tied its acute angles with a loose knot under her round chin…
</p><p>Mom worked three shifts doing the job of a Watcher at the Pumping Station. And Dad had as many shifts at the Diesel Station.
 I never learned where his workplace was located, but it surely was somewhere in the forest because one day Dad brought a piece of bread wrapped in a newspaper given him by a bunny on his way home. “So, I come home after the shift and – lo! – there's a bunny under a tree, who says, “Here you are, take it to Sehryozha, and Sasha, and Natasha.”
</p><p>The bread from bunny was much more delicious than the bread which Mom sliced for the dinner…
