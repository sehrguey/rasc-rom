  <p class="centered2 ital">Hello, sweetheart
  </p><p>Though the brief live meeting of us did not bring you to calling me “Dad”, I can’t help being sentimental when addressing you…
  </p><p>The day before yesterday in the late afternoon, executing the plan imparted to you in my last email, I climbed up the heights in the neighborhood of the ghost village of Skhtorashen to visit the local immortal – two-thousand-year-old sycamore tree, the oldest denizen of the Mountainous Karabakh.
  </p><p>The walk along the scorched ruts in a desolate dirt road winding up the slope would be a pleasure but for the oppressive August heat, and my eyes kept impulsive scanning the steep ahead to discern the signs of the water-spring asserted by all who had ever visited the place.
  </p><p>Most springs in the Mountainous Karabakh are added a water-managing structure traditionally made up of a retaining stone wall carved into the slope to protect a 5-6 meter long trough of roughly hewed stone slabs; the other, quite short, wall meets the first one on the right and is furnished with a stub of iron pipe sticking out of it over the trough butt.
  </p><p>The softly lapping stream of cool clear water runs from the pipe to fill the stone bowl embedded in the wall, for quenching people's thirst and falls from it into the knee-deep trough for cattle and other animals to drink. Brimming up the trough, the water flows over its left end to go meandering down the slope.
  </p><p>However, the water-spring by the giant tree was uncustomary flipped, with the water running in reverse – from left to right. Another surprise by the backward spring became the miss to slake my thirst which, along all the climb started at the roadside diner by the highway turn to the town of Karmir-Bazaar, prodded me with the alluring visions of gently bubbling current, but no... Because I ran into a  mahtagh.
  </p><div id="span"><p>(…The two most thrilling with their depth and beauty expressions in Armenian are:
  			<ol class="ital centered2"><li> tsahvyd tahnym; and</li><li>
  		  mahtagh ahnym.</li></ol>
  </p><p>The first of them literally means, “I’d haul your pain”. Just a couple of words, all in all,  charged with abysmally unfathomable profoundness!.
  </p><p>As for the second pair, it blares out a vow to do a sacrifice – <em> mahtagh. </em>
  </p><p>Normally, they perform a <em> mahtagh</em> as confirmation of a happy outcome. For instance, when a dear relative was very sick, yet recovered or, say, survived a car jump into a gorge, then it’s high time to do a  <em>mahtagh </em>for which end any variety of domestic animals can be slain and offered as a sacrifice, whose extent reflects the bypassed danger’s dread, as well as the prosperity of the person in charge of <em> mahtagh</em>-doing.
  </p><p>The sacrificial flesh you must  share among the relatives and neighbors to which they would proclaim the traditional felicitating formula, “Let the offer be accepted,” or else it's not a <em> mahtagh</em>.
  </p><p>Still and all, the <em>mahtagh’s</em> being edible is not the point; you may do it even with a second-hand outfit, donating a pair of worn-out but still sturdy jeans to some poverty-stricken wretch.
  </p><p>Giving is the essence of <em>mahtagh</em>, some kind of offering to be registered by the unseen, unknown, forces who are in control of fate, aka chance, aka fortune…
  </p><p>It does not take exorbitant IQ to figure out, that sacrifice to so murky figures calls into question the omnipotence of Acting Gods from leading religions in this best of worlds.
  </p><p>However, the reverent religions have long since checked and learned from their bitter experience, that eradication of certain pigheaded customs from among the irresponsible segments in their respective congregations is a hell of a lot of an uphill job, so they prefer to turn their blind eye to springing over the fires built on the shortest summer night, or round dances designed for seeing the winter off, or <em> mahtaghs </em>and other suchlike activities. What can’t be cured must be endured. Dammit!
  </p><p>Frequent use would dull anything and turn any, however profound, expression into a trite figure of speech, stripping away the feel of beauty from its meaning:
  </p><p>“<em>Tsahvyd tahnym </em>(I’d haul your pain), how’s about paying for the potatoes? Forgot?!.”
  </p><p>“<em>Mahtagh ahnym</em> (a sacrificial offering on me), a minute before I gave you six one-hundred-drahm coins! Check your pocket.”
  </p><p>“<em>Tsahvyd tahnym</em> (I’d haul your pain), I stick here since morning, there are handfuls of those coins in my pockets.”
    </p><p>“<em>Mahtagh ahnym</em> (a sacrificial offering on me), I’m not to pay twice for the same potatoes. Don’t wet your whistle too often when a-trading.”
    </p><p>In the bazaar of Stepanakert, the capital of Mountainous Karabakh, even when a-hassling, folks keep to both correct and deeply poetic stance…)
    </p></div><p>As it was said, a long cool drink from the so-much-longed-for water-spring was not my lot that day, because in the shade of the giant patriarch of a tree there was a huge  <em>mahtagh</em>-doing in full swing around two rows of tables for a hundred of participants, and from the thick of the festivity there sounded a loud yell, “Mr. Ogoltsoff!”
    </p><p>And shortly after, my arm got in a hospitably gentle, yet irresistible, grip by a burly gray-haired mujik who led me up to a young stout woman sitting at the table among the others. “You were teaching us! Do you remember me? Could recollect my name?”
    </p><p>(...well, anyway, I did teach her the word “Mister”, but what, on earth, could her name be?.)
    </p><p>“Are you ‘Ahnoosh’?”
    </p><p>My random guess ignited general delight and tender joy, that their Ahnoosh was still remembered by her name among the teaching staff at the local State University.
    </p><p>And her father, the <em> mahtagh</em>-doer, never loosening his firm welcome clutch, took me to a vacant place at the far end of males’ table, where they immediately replaced a used plate and fork, brought a clean glass and a fresh bottle of <em>tutovka</em>, while the toastmaster was already rising upon his feet with another speech about parents, children, and university diplomas...
    </p><p>The Karabakh <em>tutovka </em>(moonshine from mulberry berries) by its killing force is on a par both with “ruff” (a fifty-to-fifty mixture of vodka and beer) and “northern lights” (medicine alcohol mixed with champagne to the same proportion).
    </p><p>I mean, such a product calls for some substantial snack rejecting the principles of veganism, whereas on the richly festive table only bread and water-melon could actually pass a strict vegetarian control; nonetheless, after each toast speech I bravely gulped <em>tutovka </em>down and my dinner companion on the right, named Nelson Stepanian (a double namesake of the hero pilot fighter at the Great Patriotic War), took pains to swiftly refill my glass, hiding a hooligan grin in his sky-blue squint...
    <br>And then I was not up to no sycamores…
  </p><p>I just picked up my haversack bundled with the tent and sleeping bag and walked away across the slope to find a quiet secluded place, and there, swaying, yet closely attending the process, I rigged up the one-person  Made-in-China synthetic stent.
  </p><p>The final shreds of keeping myself in check were used for reeling to a nearby oak tree to take a leak behind its mighty trunk...
     The turn about and the very first step towards the erected tent pushed me back and smashed against the bumpy oak bole... Limp and unresisting, I slid along the crannied bark down to the tree roots and, completely spent, curdled there...
    The consciousness twilight thickened sooner than the upcoming twilight of the pending night. The dim modicum of closing horizon circle swerved in pitiless undulation, a surge of overwhelming sickness rolled up and squeezed me, I turned onto my side and, balancing on the unsteady elbow, honked over a thickly bulging root, then fell back into the sharp hard quirks of bark pressing against the back of my head.
     <br>Do fish get seasick?.
    </p><p>In the dead of night, its row chill woke me.  Gaining back the ability of upright walking was not an easy task, but, eventually, I swagged to the tent, adding on the way my worn-out groans to the grisly howls, and satanic laughter of jackal packs gone loose over the nearby slopes.
    </p><p>That night, for the first time I got it in deadly earnest that I could very easily not survive until the next morning. Terrified by the ruthless piercing grip on my chest, I lay as low as I could and waited for the dawn as for salvation. It came at last but brought no relief, and though my piteous moans were of no help at all, I didn’t have it in me to withhold them – everything was taken away by the excruciating sickness.
    </p><p>Yet, if I somehow lived through the night (it started to shakily shape in my mind), then this here Cosmos still needed me for some purpose. My first task was to regain myself, assemble me back...
     The inventory revealed a shortage of the upper denture. I plodded along to the oak, sat on my haunches and dumbly poked with a twig the shallow puddle of stiff vomit between the roots. Not there.
    </p><p>The goodnight hurl was so forceful that the prosthesis leaped half-meter farther off from the puddle, and safely spent the night on the mossy ground; the jackals needed nothing of the kind with their teeth all there, and divers other gluttonous riff-raff of the woods were not attracted by the piece of plastic for twenty thousand drahms…
    </p><p>All that day saw me sprawled under the tree by the tent. I was only able to creep along with the slow progress of the tree’s shade like a sloppy woodlouse in the gnomon‘s shadow on sundial disk.
    </p><p>“Don’t drink yourself drunk” is a truly sage adage, yet, as ages ago I tried to explain it to someone, my brake system has its own perspective on this particular subject...
    </p><p>And that same day it became very clear to me that the proximity of the arboreal long-liver was leaving no room for the serene repose and dreamy leisure of untroubled mind...
   The distant buzz of  <em>mahtagh</em> feasts replacing each other under the sycamore (although not each one was bringing a KAMAZ-truckload of tables for the activity), as well as cows wandering by to and from  the water-spring, and also their teenage shepherds all too eager for communication with prostrate strangers, and occasional passers-by either on foot or horseback gaping from the overly nigh trail at the alien looks of pale-lilac synthetic tent, on top of killing hangover, forcibly emphasized the need to find a better spot for my annual taking flight to the hills…
    </p><p>That’s why, only this morning, after filling my plastic bottle with the spring water for the trek ahead, I observed the tree closely for a report to you.
    </p><p>Indeed, one millennium is not enough to grow as big as that. The lower branches of the giant are the size of century-old trees. The bulky trunk, carrying that bunch of a grove, has a passage-like cleft in its base to admit the stream of water running from the spring (which, probably, explains the sycamore’s longevity), and even a horseman can ride into if ducking low in the saddle…
    </p><p>I also entered the tree and found myself in a murky cave illuminated by the dim daylight reaching in from the deep shade under the tree outside through the entrance and the opposite exit. It felt damp and uncomfortable in there. Several flat stones were strewn at random over the boggy ground of the floor to serve footholds. The huge barbecue box of roughly welded sheet-iron on the rusty legs of rebar-rods stuck deep in the quaggy soil inside the cavity was thickly covered with uneven layers of wax drippings from innumerate candles burned in the box. The dismal settings made you want to get out sooner, back into the clear morning.
    </p><p>So, out I went to collect my things and, with a farewell glance at the glorious sycamore, I shook my head  once again in a mute pooh-pooh at those ugly knife marks left by self-immortalizers always ready to add their memes, and esoteric symbols to any landmark the assholes can put their hands on.
    </p><p>The oldest of the mark-scars had crept, along with the bark, up to some six meters above the ground. Cut a couple of centuries ago, the upper marks got blurred and distended along with the inaudible flow of time into obscure, unreadable, contours over the uneven ripples in the gray bark that pulled the labor lost up, into inevitable oblivion…
