 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Getting ahead of its engine's roar, “Jawa” shot through the city wrapped in the night sleep, the streets empty and free of anything including the state traffic control militia...
 Then, after the thirty-kilometer-long ride along the Baturin highway, we got to the even asphalt of Moscow highway where Uncle Tolik sometimes squeezed out of his motorbike a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour…
</p><p>When we turned off onto the field roads, the dawn was gradually catching up with the 'Jawa'.
 I sat behind, grabbing Uncle Tolik by sides with my hands stuck in the pockets of his motorcyclist jacket of artificial leather so that they wouldn’t freeze away under the chilly headwind. The night around little by little transformed into twilight with the darker stretches of forest belts showing up about the fields, the sky grew lighter revealing ragged shreds of clouds that changed from white to pink to acknowledge the touches of the sky-long sun rays sent ahead from beyond the horizon...The breathtaking views imparted thrill no less than that from wild high-speed riding…
</p><p>Our usual bait were worms dug in the kitchen garden, yet once the gurus from fishermen brethren advised Uncle Tolik to try dragonfly larvae. Those critters lived underwater in clods of clay by the high river bank, and the fish just went crazy about them, like, snapping the larva-rigged hook from each other.
</p><p>We drove up to the riverbank amid murky twilight. The river lapped sleepily, wrapped in thin wisps of fog rising from the water. Uncle Tolik explained that it was me who had to fetch those lumps of clay onto the bank.
</p><p>A mere thought of entering that dark water in the dusk of still lingering night threw a shiver up the spine, but a good ride deserved a good dive. I undressed and, on the advice of the elder, took a headlong dive into the river.
</p><p>Wow! As it turned out, the water was much warmer than the damp morning chill on the bank!
</p><p>I dragged slippery lumps out of the river and Uncle Tolik broke them ashore to pick the larvae out from the tunnels they had drilled for living in clay. When he said it was enough I even didn’t want to leave the engulfing warmth of the stream…
</p><p>Still and all, it was an instance of unasked-for exploitation of adolescent labor and that same day I got square with the molesting misuser...
</p><p>Uncle Tolik preferred a spinner to a fishing rod and, with a sharp whipping thrust, he could send the lure to a splashdown almost halfway to the opposite bank of the wide river and then started to spin the reel on the tackle handle zig-zag pulling the flip-flap flash of the lure back. Predatory fish, like pine or bass, chased it and swallowed the triple hook in the tail of the lure, if the fisherman luck would have it.
</p><p>So, by noon we moved to another place with a wooden bridge across the river and Uncle Tolik walked over to the opposite, steep, bank to go along and throw the lure here and there.
I remained alone and watched the floats of the two fishing rods stuck in the sand by the current and then stretched out in the nearby grass…
</p><p>When Uncle Tolik walked the opposite bank  coming back to the bridge, I didn’t raise my head above the grass about me and watched him struggling through the jungle of knotgrass and other weeds I lay in. They use that trick for special effects when filming a movie.
 Up to the very bridge, he acted a Lilliputian for me…
</p><p>Once Aunt Lyuda asked if I had ever seen her husband entering some <em>khutta</em> during our fishing trips.
 It gave me no qualms to give an absolutely honest direct answer that, no, I hadn’t.
</p><p>As for that one time in the Popovka village, when he suddenly remembered that we had set off without any bait and left me in an empty village street to wait while he would quickly ride to someplace—not too far off—to dig up worms and be straight back, all what I saw around was the soft deep sand in the road between the towering walls of nettles and the blackened straw roof of the barn by whose side I was dropped off but no enterings, nor any<em> khattas</em> whatsoever.
 That’s why I safely could  say “no” to my inquisitive Aunt…
</p><p>There happened falls, yet just a couple of times.
The first one while riding through the field along the path on top of a meter high embankment with the tall grass flying by on both sides from the bike. I guessed it was an embankment because the tall grass was lower than our wheels, but what purpose could it serve for among the fields? The question remained unanswered because the embankment broke off suddenly among the tall grass concealing the pit into which “Jawa” nosedived after a long jump through the air, and the hard landing threw us both far ahead over the bike.
</p><p>The other time we had hardly started along Nezhin Street when the motorbike got tripped by a piece of iron pipe piled nearby someone’s <em>khutta's</em> foundation so that vehicles would not go too close by and splash at it the dirt and water from the puddles in the road…
</p><p>However, both times we got no injuries except for bumps because on our heads there were white plastic helmets.
It’s only that after the fall in Nezhin Street, the trip had to be canceled because “Jawa's” absorber began to leak oil and needed an urgent repair…
</p><p>Square of the Konotop Divisions, was called so to commemorate the Soviet Army detachments that liberated the city in the Great Patriotic War, aka WWII, and were honored for that deed with the city’s name in their respective denominations.
</p><p>For me, it,  at first, seemed the end of world because it took eight streetcar stops to get there from the Station.
</p><p>Square of the Konotop Divisions was as wide as three roads put side by side, and it had a slight slant along all of its considerable length.
</p><p>Next to the Square’s upper right corner, there stood a metal openwork tower like the famous one in Paris, yet more useful because the Konotop tower held a huge water tank on its top adorned with “I love you, Olya!” by jerky splotches of paint brush strokes over its rust-smeared side overlooking Square of the Konotop Divisions. Beneath the tower, behind the high wall bearing dense neat rows of barbered wire along its top, was the city prison.
</p><p>In the left upper corner, opposite the tower, the tall gate opened to the City Kolkhoz Market which, technically, was outside it and in Square itself the gate served the starting point for the line of small stores going down the gradual slant – “Furniture”, “Clothes”, “Shoes”…
</p><p>At its lower end Square was bounded by a tall two-story building with more windows than walls–the Konotop Sewing Factory–followed by a squat house with more walls than windows – the City Sober-up Station, yet the facility stood already in the outflowing street which led to the dangerous outskirt neighborhood of Zagrebelya.
</p><p>Its hazardous nature was established by nasty scumbags who intercepted guys from other city neighborhoods, brave enough to see   girls of Zagrebelya home. The valiant were made perform their version of rooster cry, or measure with a match the length of Zagrebelya bridge, or got just a vanilla beating from the villains…
</p><p>Square of the Konotop Divisions was crossed, bend-sinister, by the tram-track which entered it next to the long blind wall with three exit doors from the Vorontsov Movie Theater, whose entrance was from Lenin Street.
</p><p>When a mobile menagerie arrived in the city, they would arrange their trailers and cages into a big square camp in the sector between the streetcar track and the Sewing Factory. The temporary enclosure looked like the Czech Taborites defense camp from  the Hussite wars in The Medieval History textbook. Yet, inside of their corral of wagons, they placed two additional rows of cages, back to back, for the thick crowd of Konotopers and folks from the nearby villages to walk around them as well as along the cages in the inner side of the mobile perimeter wall.
</p><p>Square tablets on the cage gratings announced the name and age of the inmate, and the surf-like hum from the throng of on-lookers hung over Square of the Konotop Divisions, interspersed with wild shrieks and wailing of the caged animals.
That happened once every three years…
</p><p>And a couple of times the Wall of Death riders also visited Square of the Konotop Divisions. In front of the gate to the City Kolkhoz Market, they erected a high tarpaulin tent with a five-meter-tall ring-wall of planks inside.
</p><p>Two times a day, they let the on-lookers to climb in from outside under the tent roof and crane their on-looking faces over the wall top and watch how the riders circled arena on two motorcycles to gain the speed sufficient for getting over the ramp onto the ring-wall, and bucket along it in a horizontal plane with the deafening rumble of their motors…
</p><p>When you left Square of the Konotop Divisions by Lenin Street, moving past the Vorontsov Movie Theater towards the three-story cube of  House of Householding with all kinds of repair workshops and ateliers, then midway between the two you bypassed the tall stand constructed of iron pipes and crowned with the catching legend “DO NOT PASS BY!”
</p><p>The contraption was used for hanging black-and-white photos of people taken to the Sober-up Station, paper slips at the bottom of their glazed frames reported their names and what organizations they worked at. Some ripper creepy pictures they were, the close-ups of faces as if got skinned, or something.<br>
I felt a kinda pity for alcoholics hanging there. Probably, because of that another, far away stand at the Object which I abhorred so much. The two stands established sort of affinity between me and, well…at least, their kids…
</p><p>Farther on along Lenin Street, past a crossing, the House of Culture of the Red Metallurgist Plant stood a little way back separated from the road by the tiny square of its own.
 On both sides of that square, there also were planted stands, however, for merrier ends, presenting glue-mounted pages from satirical magazines – the Russian “Crocodile” on the left, and the Ukrainian “Pepper” on the right.
</p><p>Between the road and each of the stands, there was a tin-and-glass stall facing its symmetric twin across the square. The one by the “Crocodile” was selling ice-cream and lemonade, while all sorts of knick-knackery were the merchandise at that by the “Pepper”.
</p><p>There, among the motley keep-sake trifles, I spotted different sets of matchbox stickers and for my next trip to the city, I asked for extra kopecks and bought one, with the pictures of animals.
 However, when I brought the purchase home to enhance the collection brought from the Object, I realized it wouldn’t be right. The older stickers, peeled off their matchboxes, bore the small-printed address of the match manufacturing factory, as well as “the price – 1 kopeck”, while the set bought from the stall was just a pack of sticker-sized pictures.
Since then I had lost all interest in the collection, and passed it to my friend Skully…
</p><p>Skully lived by the Nezhin Store with his mother, and grandmother, and the dog named Pirate, although the last dwelt outside the puny house of so small a kitchen and bedroom that both would fit into the only room of our <em>khutta</em>, however, theirs was a detached property.
</p><p>Next to their<em> khutta</em> there stood an adobe-plastered shed  which, apart from usual household tools and the coal stored for winter, sheltered a handcart – an elongated box of deals resting on the axis of two iron wheels with a crossbar ending length of iron pipe that jutted from under the box bottom for handling the juggernaut when you pushed it or dragged along.
</p><p>Between the <em>khutta</em> and the wicket to the street, there stretched a long garden enclosed from both sides by the neighbors’ fences which, all in all, was bigger than those two or three vegetable beds of ours.
In autumn and spring, I came to help Skully with turning the dirt in their garden. Jabbing the bayonet spades in the soil, we gave out the fashionable Settlement byword, “No Easter cake for you, buddy! Grab a pirozhki and off to work, the beds need digging!”
</p><p>And Pirate, cut loose, frisked wildly about the elderly cherry trees bounding the narrow path to the rickety wicket…</p>
