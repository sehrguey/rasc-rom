 <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Youth<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>End  February, a year after I told Mother that I agreed to be operated on, I had to lie under the knife. A real man should keep his word, ain't it?
 </p><p>Starting in the evening and all night long, my stomach ached sharply and the ambulance, called in the morning, diagnosed the appendix that had to be removed before too late.
 I walked to the vehicle myself but there I had to lie down in the canvas stretcher placed on the floor. Mother also wanted to go, but along Nezhin Street, there was walking an acquaintance of hers, who was late for her work, and Mother forwent her place to the woman who she always praised as a very good legal consultant deserving all the possible respect.
</p><p>In the City Hospital, despite the urgency of my diagnosis, they were too lazy to carry me on the stretcher, and I had to walk up to the second floor myself. There I changed into the blue hospital gown over a white shirt with no buttons and walked to the operation room.
</p><p>They helped me to lie onto the long tall table and fixed  all my extremities to it by firm wide belts. A white sheet was thrown over a tall frame above my face so that I could not see what they were doing to my tied up parts. A nurse, whom I also could not see, stood behind my head and asked all sorts of diverting questions. The interview was obviously intended to substitute the general anesthesia because they only syringed some local anesthetic in my stomach.
</p><p>The injection took effect, I  followed how they were splitting me down there and getting into my abdomen but it felt somehow in a  distanced way as if they were doing it to my pants, although at the moment I had nothing on but the hospital shirt on me. A couple of times it really hurt though, so that I even groaned but the invisible nurse behind my pate began to pour a fiddle-faddle of what a manly patient I was, she never saw so brave, so I shut up to  let them finish their business without a distracting noise.
</p><p> However, to a cot in the long corridor, I was taken on a gurney, after all.
 </p><p>Two days later they brought me a note from Vladya. He wrote that he was down in the reception hall but they did not let him pass through, and our class would come to see me when I was allowed to get up, and I should recover as soon as possible because Chuba had got violently untame and kept jumping at Vladya like a Mazandaran tiger.
 </p><p>After the surgery, they warned me to hold back coughing and avoid any straining so that the stitches keep the cut. But could you really avoid it if having such kind of friends?
 </p><p>"Chuba Maza.." And, crumpling the paper slip in my fist, I pushed my face into the pillow to keep back the brimming up round of laughter.
 </p><p>"Mandara.. tiger.”
 </p><p>Haha! Haha!
 </p><p>"Ouch! It hurts!"
 </p><p>And even after I managed, with a lot of preservative stops, to read up the note, there was no way to ward off the jerky lines popping time and again up in my mind.
 </p><p>"Tiger Chuba Mazanda...”
 </p><p>Haha! Haha!
 </p><p>And tears seeped through my tight squinted eyelids.
  Vladya! You're worse than a tiger, O, son of a bitch!.
 </p><p>Ten days later I was discharged, and in one more week came to the hospital to have the stitches thread pulled from my stomach, and collect the reference releasing me from PE classes for one month…
 </p><p>By the by, Vladya's scrawl was more cryptic than a team of famous detectives could possibly decipher with all their methods of elementary deduction.
 </p><p>Half of the written essays he handed in were not even read by the Literature teacher who returned them unchecked but fiercely gashed, criss-cross, with red ink.
 On some occasions, he even himself failed to make out heads or tails in his own graffiti and turned to me for assistance.
 </p><p>I was the expert arbitrator in his cryptographic disputes with Zoya Ilyinichna, "No, there is nothing wrong with the spelling, he always writes "e" that way, and this one stands for "a" by him."
 </p><p>"What "e"? What "a"? They're just ticks!"
 </p><p>"Yes, for sure, but that tick's tail is, like, a bit longer. See?"
 </p><p>I had a rough talk with Father when he said I should have my hair cut, for it already was as long as it’s damn hard to say what. And because of my looks, he was summoned to the Zampolit at the RepBase.
 </p><p>The enterprise repaired not just helicopters, but military machines and instead of Directors or Managers they had high-rank officers and Zampolit’s post was that of Deputy Commander of the RepBase.
  Now, that Commander simply ordered Father to stop his son from being a frightful sight in the city.
</p><p>True, I did have a yan for sporting long hair like that by The Beatles. Though the length of theirs was beyond my reach, yet my hair had grown enough already to touch the top of the shoulder blades when I threw my head back as far as I could to marvel my profile reflection by the mirror in the wardrobe door.
 At a recent CJI match, I performed the Dean Reed's hit "Jerico" hopping on the stage with a muted mike and whipping my face with my hair.
</p><p>One good whipping deserved another. How would the RepBase Zampolit know that I was a son of their worker?
  As if few other Beatles fans were hanging out around the city. I had been told on, and no doubt about it.
</p><p>However, I couldn't have words with Father for too long because I was sitting on his neck, and Zampolit threatened him with firing  if I kept my hair any more…
</p><p>  A powerful infection swept over our school in spring. The acutest cases of grave epidemic forms  were registered in our grade which definitely turned its main locale and spiller…
</p><p>Vladya and I were seated on stools at the last desk. Quite regular stools whose black-painted seats had oblong holes in their center to inserte your hand for conveniently  moving it to some different place, if needed.
</p><p>When we got bored with exercising our carving skills, stands the black seats of our stools got ornamented with deep white scars crying out, ‘THE BEATLES! THE ROLLING STONES!”, we looked around – what else could supply us a sufficient pastime?
</p><p>Some unlimited naivety indeed – what could be out there to busy yourself with in a graduating class? Actually, nothing...
 Still and all, we gave the boredom a slip – we started writing poetry.
</p><p>It was a prolific poetic eruption turned out in various forms and genres. At the break, we presented our creations to the classmates. We laughed and they were laughing too, unaware that the virus of poeticizing had already started the inexorable destruction of their immune system.
  Many of them began trying their hand at the production of rhymed lines. Even Chuba turned out some trifle of an epigram. But the indisputable crest-riders of that wave were sitting, sure enough, at the last desk.
 </p><p>Fortunately, the epidemic eventually died down without fatalities.
 </p><div id=span><p>(...if those scattered pieces of ruled paper torn off from various notebooks were put together, it could become a collection of aspirant poets. And, stashed away in bookstores stacks, it would accumulate the dust there submerged into its drowsy dreams of eager readers' hands and rising to the fame...
 </p><p>It is highly improbable that any of my classmates would recollect that overweening epidemic. None of them would recognize even their own lines, betcha. But, after all, who cares? The final goal is nothing. The main buzz is in doing.
  Although, I'm still not ashamed of the lengthy elegy crafted at a lesson in Organic Chemistry:
</p><figure><p class="centered2 bold ital">“The day will come for me to join the robbers
  	<br>To earn my honest daily bread<br>
  	I'll sleep all day and chew on dried grasshoppers<br>
  	At night, stray walkers will I intercept...”</figure>
 </p><p>Then, of course, I would get killed because elegy is a traditionally sad genre and, lying in the tall grass by the highway:
 </p><figure><p class="centered2 bold ital">“I won't grasp it with my head by nearing Death already chilled<br>
  	If so urgent was indeed for you to have me killed?<br>
 	Of wood was made my pistol, it wouldn't harm a lamb,<br>
  	With gentle "Hello!" I fleeced the clients<br>
  	Yet left them kopecks for a tram,<br>
  	“Take ‘t easy, folks! So’s my job.”<br>
  	Then soft "Adieu!" and – parting bob...”
 </p></figure><p>A lot of water has flowed in the river of Varanda since then and, quoting the classic poet, handled Monkey, who worshiped  banks of the Neva river:
 	</p><figure><p class="centered2 bold ital">" Some aren't there anymore, and I am far away...”
 </p></figure><p>Okay. That's enough for flashing up my speckles of erudition...
 It's time to confess that I wasn't a stranger to swindling too.
 There are things you'd prefer not to remember before starting to recount them...
 </p><p>However, showing oneself off entirely good and irreproachable is foolish and dishonest. It's not a righteous thing, I mean.
  Anyway, I am not a good guy, I’m way too unsteady for that...)
 </p></div><p>So, as it was said already, that year we lost the CJI final to the prestigious School 11.
  In the Contest of Greetings, we dragged out on stage a dummy ship of cardboard, exactly the same as two months before us they dragged out at the Central Television CJI. And they also joked our jokes there, two months before. Both the ship and jokes were still fresh in the memory of the jury members and we were accused of blatant plagiarism in the end.
</p><p>The team of School 11 came out in top hats made of blackened Whatman paper and finishing their Greeting presented the hats to our team. I did not get my share, because their Captain left his one on the jury desk to bribe them into the right choice when taking  the right decision.
</p><p>After the defeat, going home without shields but with top hats, our team members were doffing the paper head-gears at the Settlement crossroads goodbyeing each other and I felt hurt that only I didn't have the thing.
</p><p>By the moment when   the streetcar stop School 13 was reached, there remained just two of all the team – Valya Pisanko and me.
</p><p>And then I insidiously asked Valya for her top hat, like, just to try it on. She credulously gave it and, clapping the paper thing onto my head, I ran away along Nezhin Street.
</p><p>I knew she wouldn't follow, she lived in Podlipnoye and had to turn in the opposite direction. Indeed, she didn't chase and only screamed behind, "Sehguey! Give it back! It's not fair!" I knew it was not fair, but I did not return and did not give it back. Why should I?
</p><p>The next morning in the lean-to which served as my bedroom already, I was nauseated by the sight of that piece of Whatman paper blackened with gouache; some disgusting loot.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...so, I'm assembled of divers parts and meanness enters in the aggregation...)</p></div>
