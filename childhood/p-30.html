<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The middle of the square where the camp’s platoons fell in was reserved for patches of loosened ground, a patch per platoon. Each day children laid out the date in their platoon's patch with green cones, or fresh twigs, or chopped off flower heads competing for the Best Designed Platoon Calendar.
</p><p>On Sundays, a big bus was bringing to the camp a pack of parents to treat their children with gingerbread, and sweets, and – lemonade!
</p><p>Our Mom was taking us over into the greenish shade of trees and watched as we chewed and swallowed, and asked questions about the camp life, while Dad clicked his brand new FED-2 camera.
</p><p>Consuming the treats, we were sharing that the camp life was quite like a camp life.
</p><p>That not long before, all the platoons went out for a hike in the forest and on our return – surprise! There was a restaurant waiting for us on the floor-boarded platform of the pergola, outside the cinema room in the barrack.
</p><p>As it turned out, the girls of the senior platoon did not participate in hiking and instead set up tables and chairs in the pergola, and cooked the dinner together with the canteen workers. Handwritten menu sheets were put on the tables, and everyone sitting around them summoned the girls with the adult word “Waitress!” And they approached to get the order for  “May Salad” or  “Onion Salad”, the only two items on the menu.
</p><p>When the restaurant was over, I accidentally overheard two of the waitresses giggling between themselves that everyone asked for   “May Salad” while  “Onion Salad” was way more delicious and thus the waitresses’ share became bigger thanks to the fools ready to be hooked on mere look of words on a piece of paper.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…and I promised myself in future never get fooled with tinsel wrappers.)
</p></div><p>Regrettably, the daily schedule in the camp retained an obnoxious vestige from the kindergarten past under the new name of “stiff hour”. After the midday meal, everyone should go to their wards and to their beds. Get asleep!
</p><p>Sleeping in the middle of a day just did not work and the two-hour-long “stiff hour” progressed at a snail rate. All the spooky stories had been told and listened to for the millionth time, both about the woman in white who drank her own blood, and about the  flying black hand that had no body to it but kept regularly strangling anyone on its way, and all the other gory horrors, yet there still remained the same thirty-eight minutes before the long-awaited-for shout “Get up!.”
</p><p>Once at the midday meal in the canteen, I got aware of obviously clandestine gestures of three boys at my table, their exchange of silent nods and winks was nothing but some double talk with secret code signs. Clear as daylight – there was some collusion. And me?
</p><p>So I accosted one of them in earnest until he shared the secret scheme. They conspired to flee the “stiff hour” that day and go to the forest, where one of them knew a spot with such raspberries that had more berries than leaves in their bushes.
</p><p>The midday meal over, the boys ran stealthily in the direction opposite to the barrack. I followed them, repulsed the leader’s attempt at turning me back to the ward-bedroom, and crawled after the others under the barbed wire of the fence into the forest.
</p><p>We armed ourselves with the rifles made of breakable tree branches and walked along a wide footpath among the pines and shrubs. Then the commander turned into some glade after which we again went into the forest, but already with no footpath there. We wandered for a long time without finding any raspberries but only the bushes of wolf-berries which you should skip eating because they’re poisonous.
</p><p>Finally, we got fed up with the useless search, and our commander confessed he could not find the promised raspberries, so he was reproached with multi-voiced “eew! you!”, and our wandering through the forest went on until we came across the barbed wire nailed to the trees to form a fence.
</p><p>Following the prickly guidance of the camp fencing, we went out to the already familiar footpath and our perked-up commander ordered to fall in. It seemed as we were going to play War-Mommy. The command was bravely executed and we lined-up along the footpath, pressing the dried boughs of our assault rifles to our stomachs.
</p><p>But suddenly, two grown-up women—the camp caretakers—jumped from behind a thick bush with a loud yell, “Drop  weapons down!” We let our sticks fall and, in the already formed file, were convoyed to the camp gate. One of the captors walked ahead of us, the other closed the formation.
</p><p>At the evening all-out line-up, Camp Director announced that there happened an incident at the camp, and the parents of those involved would be informed, besides, there would be raised the question of expelling the fugitives from the camp.
</p><p>After the line-up dispersed, my brother and sister came to me from their junior platoon, “Now, you’ll sure get hell!”
</p><p>“Ah!” dismissively waved I, trying to conceal the fear caused by the uncertainty of the punishment for getting raised the question of expelling. That uncertainty nagged me till the end of the week with the Parents’ Day on Sunday…
</p><p>Our parents came as usual, and Mom shared between us condensed milk and biscuits, but she never mentioned my involvement in the disruptive occurrence. A beam of hope flicked for me – perhaps, Camp Director forgot to inform my parents!
</p><p>When they left, Natasha told me that Mom had already known about the incident and, in my absence, asked her who else was among the runaways.
</p><p>On getting the complete report, she turned to Dad and said, “Well, you bet, such ones aren’t going to be expelled.”
</p><p>At the end of that same summer, there occurred a drastic change in our Block’s way of life. Now, every morning and evening, a slow-go garbage truck entered the Courtyard, honked loudly and waited for the tenants of the houses to bring their garbage buckets and empty them into its dump. Besides, they took away the rusty boxes from the garbage bins enclosure and nailed up its gate.
</p><p>In September in the field between the Bugorok-Knoll and the defunct enclosure, there for several days roared and clattered a bulldozer moving mountains of earth. Then it disappeared, leaving behind a wide field leveled two meters lower than the one we used to play football in, yet without a single grass blade  crisscrosed instead with footprints of its caterpillar tracks in the raw ground…
</p><p>A month later, they organized a Sunday of Collective Free Work for adults only, but my Dad allowed me to go with him too.
</p><p>On the edge of the wood behind the next block, there stood a long building very much alike to the barrack in the pioneer camp, and the people who participated in the Sunday of Collective Free Work attacked it from all ends and started to demolish.
</p><p>My Dad climbed to the very top. He tore away whole chunks of the roof and sent them down shouting his farewell, “Eh! Pulling down in not building up – no painstaking cares!”
</p><p>I liked that Sunday of Collective Free Work very little because they would drive you away everywhere, “Don’t come closer!” And simply listening to the screams of nails being torn from the beams and boards, becomes boring quite soon…
</p><div id="span"><p>(…I cannot now recollect if it was it on the eve of that Sunday or immediately after it, that Nikita Khrushchev got deposed and Leonid Brezhnev became the ruler of the USSR in his place.
</p><p>Ew! So untimely! When there remained no more than a mere eighteen years before Communism to be established in our country!.)
</p></div><p>In his very practical book, Ernest Seton-Thompson insists that bows have to be made of ash-tree boughs. But could you find an ash-tree at the Object, please?
</p><p>The woods around the Block were populated with pines and fir trees, as well as deciduous birch and aspen, and all the rest might be considered just shrubs. That’s why, following the advice of the neighbor from our landing, Stepan Zimin, my bows were made of the juniper.
</p><p>It’s important to make the right choice because the juniper for a bow should not be too old with lots of side branches, neither too thick which would be impossible to bend. A tree of about one-and-a-half-meter tall would be the thing, both springy and strong. The arrow shot with the bow made of such a juniper would rise in the gray autumn sky about thirty meters or so, you’d barely see it before its precipitous down-fall to stick in the ground with the arrowhead of a nail fixed with electrical tape.
</p><p>The best material for an arrow shaft is a thin plaster lath, all you have to do is just split it lengthwise, round and shave the shaft off with a knife, then polish with sandpaper. Only my arrows had no fletching, although Seton-Thompson explained how to do it. But where could I get the feathers from? No use to ask Dad, there’s nothing but machinery at his work…</p>
