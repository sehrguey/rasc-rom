<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Solitary Barge Hauler<br>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>
On the whole, the work that followed was not a re-translation, poor Guilia made to betray her lover was still vividly contained in my mind and, one month later, I took my last translation to Zhomnir, but already without the briefcase.
So, albeit with a month's delay, my decision to part with Maugham was executed.
However, it was only a part in a broader plan of action.
</p><p>Like any other of my plans, it was lacking clear concrete details. My plans, as it were, could hardly be called plans at all, being, like,  feelings that it was necessary to do this or that. Details to the plans came only afterward – in the course of execution.
The afore-mentioned broad plan arose because I, finally, realized that Zhomnir would do "match-making" for none of my translations. Both never, and nowhere. And it did not matter why, the main thing was that it was for sure.
So what now? Very simple, the issue of publication should be solved in a make-it-yourself way.
</p><p>To go that way, I had to take from Zhomnir all my translations in thin  copybooks for school,  of differently colored covers, piled  among manifol papers stacks somewhere on his archive chamber shelves...
I arrived in Nezhin and announced to him  my intention to take back my still-not-alpha versions of Maugham in Ukrainian. Zhomnir did not object and did not ask any questions.
</p><p>He arranged a feast because during these years I became sort of a distant relative in his house. A dinky needy relative of no consequence, but  handy at times when, say, pasting the living-room in his apartment with the wallpaper...
We sat at the square table, pushed from the wall to the center of the living room, and ate everything being brought by Maria Antonovna from the kitchen. We drank a strong village hooch.
Zhomnir was enthusiastically discussing the gold pectoral of great artistic value, recently excavated from an ancient mound in the steppe.
Changing the subject, he asked how my current relations with Nezhin were, meaning Eera.
</p><p>I proudly stated those relations to be fruitful, meaning you.
Then I cautiously asked how Eera was.
</p><p>"How what?", answered Zhomnir. "Whoring about the city."
</p><p>It rammed me in the solar plexus, although not as hard as the words of Eera that she had a certain Sasha, about who she cared to inform my sister Natasha, who withheld the news until my divorce with Eera, to make a booby prize of it, I suppose.
Most of all, I was struck by the complete coincidence of Zhomnir's response with the words of the mujik at the Konotop brick factory replying to my question about Olga.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...for all the difference in educational and cultural level, when we need to knock our neighbor's brains out, we use the same old good stone ax...)
</p></div><p>When it was time to set off for the local train, Zhomnir put all the copybooks with my translations in a cellophane bag that turned tight and heavy, and went out to escort me to the station.
That hooch was damn well strong stuff, but I remember how the local train pulled up and hissed to slam the doors open.
Refusing Zhomnir's assistance, I headed into the round tunnel of the car vestibule with gleamy curves of nickel-plated handrails in its unsteady sides.
Catching the left one, I climbed inside, went over to the opposite, closed, door and hung the bag on the top-knob of the handrail there.
The last thing I heard was the sound of the door slamming shut behind me...
</p><p> Slowly coming to my senses in the gradually emerging car vestibule, I still clutched in my left hand the top-knob of the handrail by the closed door.
The train stood as motionless as I, at the fourth platform of the Konotop railway station.
It was empty of passengers because according to the timetable its departure to Khutor Mikhailovsky was in two hours after its arrival in Konotop.
</p><p>The sight of the empty handrail beneath my clutch turned my abdominal muscles stone hard and stopped still my breathing.
On the remaining three  top-knobs in the car vestibule, there was no cellophane bag neither.
Slamming the sliding door, I went into the empty car and glanced along the empty rack rails above the windows, then I returned to the vestibule and exhaled: hooooey!
</p><p>I did not feel like sitting in the leatherette-covered seats of the empty local train, I walked through the underground passage and over the station square to the Loony park, to a hard, wooden, bench.
There I sat for a long time without any thoughts, only now and then imagining myself in the form of a stupidly frozen statue by the handrail, while they were removing the cellophane bag.
Who?!. Doesn't matter, makes no difference...
Whoever the pillager, they hardly got  happy with so a useless spoil, except for kindling firewood in their stove, it would do for quite a few winters.
</p><p>After the stupefied shell-shock sitting for about an hour, I remembered that it was SMP-615 on-duty day in the public order squad and I dragged myself to the stronghold room to sit on further – indifferent, detached, and silent.
</p><p>Only with the arrival of the militia officer, I knew what to do next.
"Comrade Captain, lend me tree rubles till our next turn on duty."
</p><p>"I do not lend in rubles. Only in days of arrest. Fifteen enough?"
</p><p>His dull wit only confirmed the correctness of my plan…
The next day, three rubles were borrowed from our team and, after work, I went to Nezhin.
There, in the five-story block for the institute teachers in the Count's Park, I found the apartment of ever-smiling Nona and said her that, after several years of work, I lost all of my translations from Maugham.
Now, for their restoration, I needed the originals of the stories, all of which were collected in the four-volume edition by the Penguin Publishing House that was in her possession. Could she, please?.
</p><p>With her usual sweet smile, Nona brought the books, placed them into a cellophane bag, and handed over to me. With what a joy my heart was pounding – thank you!.
</p><p>"How do you like it, Maria Antonovna? This scoundrel of Ogoltsoff lost all of his translations in the local train!"
</p><p>"Because you shouldn't have made the poor boy drink so much!"
</p><p>Maria Antonovna also did not know that all my misfortunes or joys, ups, and downs, all my pleasures, and deprivations were determined by that rascal on the Varanda River bank in the inconceivably faraway future...</p>
