<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>And again it was summer only this  time it started much earlier than in the previous years. And together with that summer, the Rechka river rushed into my life. Or maybe, the limits of my living space had expanded enough to reach it.
</p><p>To start the relations with the Rechka, at first, I needed a company of boys more advanced in their years who walked ahead downhill along the road with the heat-softened pitch filling the joints between large concrete slabs, which leg I knew quite well though, because of my visits to the Detachment’s Library. Then followed an unknown shortcut by a footpath through the shady thicket on a steep slope until there all at once unfurled the sparkling sunlit flow of the Rechka lapping among innumerable boulders of all sizes.
</p><p>You could cross the ten-meter-wide river without getting deeper than to your waist or you might stand instead knee-deep in its fast current and watch a school of translucent whitebait poking ticklishly at your ankles in the greenish twilight of the incessantly rolling mass of water…
</p><p>When out of the river, we played Key-or-lock, betting on the form of the splash made by a stone hurled into the water. If the splash raised up like a stick, that was counted “a key”, while a wider, bush-like, splash went for “lock”. At contestable cases, the last word remained with by the boy who played football better, or whose pebble did more leaps at “baking pancakes” over the water surface…
</p><p>Soon I began to go to the Rechka alone or with just one partner, yet on the river bank we parted because our main concern was fishing.
</p><p>All the tackle consisted of a fishing pole—a cut-down willow whip—with a length of line tied on its end. The line was threaded through the float and ended with the hook, accompanied by a tiny lead sinker. The float could be made of a brownish wine cork, a match stuck into the hole with the threaded line kept it in place, or you could use one  bought at the Sports Goods—a plucked and pared goose feather painted red-and-white: both popped equally well on the rushing ripples of the rapid current, or turned thoughtfully still in a small backwater behind bigger boulders…
</p><p>Fishing is something personal. One boy pins his hopes on that quiet inlet, the other prefers to have his float hopping on the rapids. That’s why companions get parted on the river bank.
</p><p>Fishing is a churned-up surge of rocketing excitement at the slightest start of the float. Hush! Striking!.
The line does not yield, it jibs, bends the pole, cuts the water in zigzags, then suddenly gives up and, jumping over your head, carries to you the sparkling flutter of the caught fish!
 Then, of course, it turns to be not a fish but a small fry. Never mind! The next catch will be tha-a-at big!.
</p><p>More often than anything else there was one of the “miserables” on the hook. I never learned their scientific name. Those fools got caught even with a bare hook, without any bait at all. And they could be hooked at any part of them – at the tail, or the belly, or an eye. Who would bother inventing a special name for such a moron minnow?
</p><p>Back from the fishing, I usually brought half-dozen of small fry sleeping in a milk-can, and Paulinna Zimin’s cat devoured them with greedy purr and snap from a saucer put on the landing tiles…
</p><p>That day I started fishing from the bridge between the Pumping Station and Checkpoint on the road out from the Zone.
</p><p>As usual, I walked after the current, refreshing the bait, adjusting the depth of the hook immersion.
 I was a steadfast fisherman and only once let myself get distracted from bobs and jerks of the float in the current. It happened on the sandy spit near the green bush, where I carried out some restoration work mending the sand sculpture of a woman stretched on her back.
</p><p>The masterpiece was created a couple of days before by two soldiers. You could guess at a glance that they were soldiers because of their black underpants and black high boots. Who else would wear such boots in summer?.
</p><p>I increased the sagging breasts and slightly rounded the hips of the sculpture. They seemed to be wider than necessary but I did not correct it.
</p><p>Why did I do it at all? Very clear, it’s not right to let the work of art to disappear in the rest of the sand with all the soldiers’ labor gone to ashes…
</p><div id="span"><p>(…or was I hooked on the opportunity to spank a female bust and thighs even if just made of sand?
</p><p>Eew! To hell with Freud and other miserables from psychoanalytic schools!
</p><p>Let’s go back fishing, it’s much more fun…)
</p></div><p>…and I did not roll on top of her like one of the soldiers two days before, but just returned to fishing.
</p><p>The current carried the float to the broken dam below the stadium, where ages ago I stumbled off the insidious slab. The point marked half of the Rechka having been  passed already and after the other half it would run beyond the Zone, away from the barbed wire in doubled fence on two rows of poles bounding the strip of loosened ground in between the walls of wire for catching footprints of the NATO spies.
</p><p>Half of the walk along the river was over and the three-liter milk-can contained just a couple of “miserables”. The neighbor’s cat would be disappointed.
</p><p>When down the stream there loomed the second (and also last) bridge in the Zone, I decided not to go any farther but try my luck at the sharp bend of the current under the precipitous drop-off in the bank.
 And right there happened that after what folks go fishing at all. The float did not twitch or flinch but  went under the surface deep and slowly. I pulled back and the vibrating pole in my hands responded with the strangely unyielding resistance. No fish jumped from the water wiggling in its flight over the air. I had to pull the tight line all the way closer and closer and finally drag it onto the dry land…
 The fish twisted and arched and beat the sand, scaring me with its might and size, never had I seen the like of that dark blue piece of alive thick hose.
</p><p>I threw the “miserables” back to the river, filled the can with water, and lowered the pray into it but the fish had to stand there upright – its length did not allow for tumbling in the can.
</p><p>Two boys came from the bridge, they had already finished fishing and were on their way home. They asked me about the catch and I showed them the fish. “Burbot!” without a sec of hesitation identified one of them.
</p><p>When they left, I realized that I couldn’t catch anything better, that it was time to cut the line and go home…
 I walked up the Gorka hill and the glory ran before me – a couple of boys met me some hundred meters out of the Block. They wanted to have a look at the burbot. And when I was already nearing our house, an unfamiliar auntie from the corner building stopped me on the path to ask if that was true.
</p><p>She peeped into the can at the round muzzle of the burbot turned asleep by that time, and asked me to give it to her.
</p><p>I immediately handed the milk-can over and waited while she carried the fish to her home and brought the can back, because it’s only right to do what you’re told to by grow-ups…
</p><p>In those years, a year was much longer than nowadays and it was packed with bigger number of memorable events. For instance, in the same summer with the burbot my sister, and brother, and I went to the pioneer camp, though we were not young pioneers yet.
</p><p>One sunny morning the children from our Block, and from the twin one, and the lowlander-children from the wooden houses by the foot of the Gorka hill collected at the House of Officers where two buses and two trucks with canvas tops were waiting for us. Parents gave their respective children suitcases with clothes, and bags full of sweets and other tasty things, and waved after the departing convoy.
</p><p>We went over the bridge at the Pumping Station and passed the white gate of Checkpoint, leaving the Object behind the barbed wire that surrounded all of it together with the forest, hills, marshes and a stretch of the Rechka.
</p><p>After Checkpoint, we turned to the right, climbing a protracted slant of the highway which we followed for about half an hour before another turn to the right to follow a  dirt road in the forest of great pine trees. There, the convoy had to slow down and, after a twenty-minute ride, we drove up to another gate in another fence of barbed wire. However, that fence wasn’t doubled, and there were no sentries at the gate because it was a pioneer camp.
</p><p>Not far from the gate, there stood a one-story building with the canteen and the rooms for caretakers, and paramedic, and Camp Director, and other employees at the camp. Behind that building, there stretched a wide field marked by a tall iron mast of “giant leaps” with the iron wheel on its top, from which there hung half-dozen canvas loops on thoroughly rusted chains because no one ever used the attraction. Beneath the row of tall birch trees along the left edge of the field, there ran a neat cinder path to the pit for broad jumps. Across the field, the forest began again, parted from the camp with the couple lines of barbed wire  nailed randomly to  thicker trunks from among the trees.
</p><p>To the left of the canteen building, a growth of green bushes screened four square canvas tents with a board floor and four beds each, for the ninth-graders from the first platoon.
</p><p>Then followed a level clearing with another iron mast, this time more slender and without chains but with one thin cable looped trough two small pulleys—atop the mast and near the ground—for the Red Flag of the camp.
 Each morning and each evening the platoons were lined-up along three sides of a large rectangular, facing inside. The iron mast, Camp Director, Senior Pioneer Leader, and the camp accordionist concluded the rectangular as the fourth—fairly rarefied—side of the perimeter.
</p><p>The commanders of the platoons, starting with the youngest, approached, in turn, Senior Pioneer Leader to report that their platoon was lined-up. During their report, both the commanders and Senior Pioneer Leader held their right elbows up, hands straightened and kept diagonally across their respective faces.
</p><p>With the reports received from the commanders of all lined-up platoons, Senior Pioneer Leader went several steps ahead towards the center of the formation, yet without reaching it turned around and approached Camp Director to report that the camp was lined-up, and Camp Director responded with the order to hoist or to lower the Red Flag of the camp, depending on the time of day.
</p><p>The accordionist stretched the bellows of his instrument and played the hymn of the Soviet Union. Two rank-and-file pioneers called out by Senior Pioneer Leader for their recent achievements and overall merits in the camp life approached the mast.
 Standing on both sides from it, they pulled the cable running through two pulleys, their hands taking turns at grabbing the cable, and the Red Flag of the camp crept in starts and jerks along the mast, up in the morning and down in the evening, while the lined-up formation stood with their right elbows up, hands straightened and kept diagonally across their respective faces, even Camp Director, caretakers and kids from the youngest platoon though none of them was age eligible for this pioneer salutation…
</p><p>The clearing with the flag mast was followed by a short tilt, down which there stood a long squat barrack of planks with two large bedroom-wards separated by the  central blind partition and filled with rows of spring-mesh beds abutting the windowed sidewalls. Each of the wards ended with the door to the shared square room comprising the whole width of the barrack. There was a small stage with a screen for movie shows and rows of seats for the audience.
</p><p>Entering the bedroom-wards on the day of arrival, the children were not in a hurry to go and get mattresses, sheets, and blankets from the canteen-etc. building, but instead, they dropped their bags and suitcases on the floor and went amok, leap-racing along the spring-mesh trail of the lined beds which tossed you up in long jumps through the air. For that particular sports activity, it’s vitally important not to collide with a jumper rushing in the opposite direction...
</p><p>Then everyone opened their suitcases and bags and started to enjoy the sweets, flashing them down with the gulps of treacly condensed milk from blue-and-white tin-cans.
As it turned out, for condensed milk consuming, neither an opener nor a spoon was needed. Just find a nail sticking out on the wall and hit the can lid against it to punch a hole. Make sure the hole’s location is near the lid edge and not in its center. Produce another hole in the lid opposite to the first one and – here you are! – now the condensed milk can easily be sucked out through any of the holes without smearing your lips and cheeks, as when eating with a spoon from an open tin-can... And if you are not a well-trained puncher, or not tall enough to reach the nail up in the wall, then ask someone of the elder boys – they would readily punch it for you for just a couple of hearty sucks  from your can…</p>
