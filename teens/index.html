     <p>(…and, probably, that’s it. Enough is enough.
     It is time to roll the potatoes out from among the glowing ashes before they turned firebrands too.
   </p><p>Though coals are crammed with kilocalories, I am not quite sure about the taste of those beasts. Besides, it’s getting pretty dark and I’d rather not overeat at so late an hour. “And leave your dinner”, said some sage dietitian, “to your enemy”. Which is a pretty useless piece of wisdom in my case. Where would I get them those enemies from? I've been raised and formatted for life in a society where each man is a friend, a comrade, and a brother to any other man…
   </p><p>Damn, but it’s so tempting to share  the bullshit you once were fed with (and in ladlefuls too!) up to your ears. So, one day I gave out all homilies to your elder step-sister, Lenochka, like, being good and kind was the innate feature of mankind at large and people's one and only distressing flaw was their ignorance of how immensely good they were deep inside, a sad pity!
   </p><p>Alas! As my perversive stars deigned to have it, there was Shakespeare’s “Richard III” on TV that same evening. What a treat! She stuck in the tube and watched, mesmerized,  how all those good and kind people (sadly, uninformed of their hidden goodness) were strangling and shredding each other and cutting throats for a change. And sure enough, the next morning she watched the rerun too because Shakespeare isn’t a knickknack you can give the shake, it’s classic. Since then, my political line regarding the TV is that of armed neutrality.
     </p><p>Well, so much to emphasize the fact that, if I chance to come across an accidental enemy, I’d sooner give them my last shirt but not my dinner, moreover, the potatoes baked in the fire ashes.
     </p><p>The moment you break their charred crust and pour a pinch of salt into the steamy core, you see the light of Truth that no oysters, nor lobsters, nor any other fancy kulebyaki can hold a candle to them. Oh, no! Not a chance.
     </p><p>For their sake, I'd readily leave any freaky nourishment to abstruse gourmets ‘cause we, uncouth and simple-minded garlic eaters, have no use for neither calipash nor calipee – no! Our modest aim is a simple, ample, grub and plum dough, we’re not after excessive luxuries.
     </p><p>And were I a younger man but not a Negro advanced in my years and pressed by all kinds of problems which the struggle for life trickles with, then to them, and them only, would I dedicate an ode of love and gratitude – to potatoes baked amidst the fire ashes.
     </p><p>No wonder, that in the most poignant episode in all the pulp fiction series by Julian Semenov, his main protagonist Stirlitz, aka Soviet secret service agent Isaev, turns up the sleeves of his spiffy Fascist uniform and bakes potatoes in the fireplace of his Berlin apartment to celebrate the Soviet Army and Navy Day.
     </p><p>However, with all due admiration at his culinary patriotism, no, sir, dat’s ain’t da thin’. To understand the taste of baked potatoes, you need to sit on the ground, under the open sky, with an evening like this one here around you…)
     </p></div><p>In Konotop, Grandma Katya in turn kissed all of us, confusedly standing in her kitchen, and started crying.
     </p><p>Mother tried to console her and, noticing two kids’ heads that peeked from behind the doors to the room, asked if they were her sister’s children.
     </p><p>“Yes, here we have our Irochka and Valerik. So big kids already. The girl is three years old and he soon will be two.”
     </p><p>When their father, Uncle Tolik, came home from his work. I for the first time saw, not in a movie but in real life, a man with a bald patch extending from the forehead to the back of his head, however, I tried not to ogle too obviously.
     </p><p>An hour later he and I went out to meet my Aunt Lyuda.
   The store she worked at closed at seven and, coming home, she always carried bags from her work.
 </p><p>While walking with Uncle Tolik, I marked the way to the Underpass, which the Konotopers were still calling Overpass...
      Among my vague recollections, there was a long wait in front of a lowered railway barrier blocking way to the overpass made of smeared wooden sleepers to bridge the gaps between the rail-heads, and how the barrier went up giving rise to agitated commotion in a ruck of people, who rushed from both sides to cross the railway, together with a couple of horse drawn telega-carts and an odd truck. That time we were going from Konotop to the Object…
     </p><p>In my absence, they built a spacey concrete tunnel under the multi-track railway, hence the official name – Underpass, but folks kept calling it the old way – Overpass…
     </p><p>On the other side of the Under-Overpass, long red streetcars were running from the City to the Station and back. Before Aunt Lyuda arrived by one of the streetcars coming from the City, Uncle Tolik talked me into approaching her under the rare lamps over the tilt into the Under-Overpass, while he’d keep out of sight, and, grabbing one of her bags, I had to ask in a husky voice: “Not too heavy for you?” But she recognized me even though Uncle Tolik had drawn the peak of my cap low down over my eyes.
     </p><p>The three of us walked back to Nezhin Street, and Uncle Tolik carried the bags with food which Aunt Lyuda was taking from the store she worked at to squared up at her payday.
     </p><p>On climbing up out of the Underpass, we crossed Bazaar along the wide aisle between the rows of empty at that hour counters with the tall lean-to roofs over them, like, lined-up abandoned gazebos, and after walking for another ten minutes, we turned into Nezhin Street; a couple of distant lights on far-off lampposts in its depth distinguished it from among the rest, unlighted, streets…
     </p><p>In Konotop, we arrived at the start of the last quarter in the academic year and both I and the twins became students at School 13 which very conveniently stood right opposite Nezhin Street, across fieldstone-cobbled Bogdan Khmelnytskyi Street.
     </p><p>Old folks called it “Cherevko’s school” because under the Czar, some rich man from the nearby village of Podlipnoye, Cherevko was his name, built a two-story pub-house, but the then authorities didn’t allow him to operate it because the would-be pub’s location was too near to the only factory in the city, threatening to make drunks of the local working class en masse, so Cherevko donated the building to the city for arranging a school of four classrooms in it.
     </p><p>In the Soviet era, the workingmen's self-consciousness boosted so high that present-day pubs moved two-three times closer to the same plant and “Cherevko’s school” was expanded with a long one-story building in the pronounced barrack style, also of bricks. The addition stretched along a quiet side street slanting toward the Swamp named, interchangeably, the Grove, that separated the village of Podlipnoye from Konotop or vice versa.
     </p><p>Going to school for the first time, I couldn’t get the meaning of canvas pouches dangling alongside the schoolbags or sizable leatherette folders by the students walking in the same direction.
     </p><p>I was surprised to learn that in the pouches they carried to school their ink-pots. It felt a little out-of-date because the schoolchildren at the Object had long since started using fountain pens with an inside ink-tank whose capacity allowed for refilling it no oftener than once a week if you did not write too much. At first, it seemed, like, getting from the era of gasoline engines back to the epoch of post stages, yet the very next morning same pouches did not look as something overly striking anymore.
     </p><p> Protracted deafening ding-and-dong of the huge electric bell filled the long corridor of the one-story building, as well as the whole yard with the “Cherevko’s school” in it and three adjoining streets in the neighborhood. If it signaled a break, everyone went out into the wide schoolyard with an ancient tree in its center and the low building behind it, which comprised the Pioneer Room, the workshop for Handicraft lessons, the school library and, as I learned later, the ski storage room.
     </p><p>The gym, with its windows grated from inside to prevent smashing the panes with ball hits at PE classes, abutted the far end of the barrack-like building at the right angle. Opposite the blind end wall of the gym, there stood a detached whitewashed brick hut of toilets.
     </p><p>All the break long, a swarm of students hung out at the  high stoop of three stairs by the entrance door.   The horizontal parts of side railings were neatly perched  by bigger boys until a maverick teacher would shoo them off and they reluctantly comply only to nimbly light back up again the moment the teacher’s back vanished in the  doorway.
     </p><p>A lively trickle of students kept flowing to and from the toilets in the yard corner, yet the majority of boys (and  boys only!) veered before reaching the toilets hut and turned round the gym corner.
     </p><p>There, in the narrow passage between the gym and the tall fence of the neighboring garden, life ran high in a brisk cash game for ready money with the average stake in the game of <em>Bitok</em> at the school Las Vegas grounds from two to five copper kopecks. If you had nickels, say, ten, fifteen, twenty or even fifty-kopeck in one piece, it’d be exchanged before you say “knife”.
     </p><p>With the stakes stacked on the ground, one atop the other with every coin heads up, the <em>bitok</em> came into play.
     </p><p>What’s a <em>bitok</em>? It’s hard to say – every player had his favorite hunk of iron: a bolt, a railroad spike, a polished ball from a huge bearing – there were no limits, you could use whatever you wanted, be it even a stone. And even the absence of any gear was no problem – anyone would readily lend you his <em>bitok</em> for hitting.
     </p><p>Hitting what? That stack of kopecks, of course!.
     All the coins turned over by your hit and showing their tails became yours. Collect them into your pocket and hit the remaining stubborn heads, one by one. With no coin turned over, the next player started his tries.
   </p><p>And who was to open the game? Quite logically, the one who put the highest stake into the stack…
   </p><p>At times, the warning cry of “shuba!” from the gym corner signaled the approach of some male teacher. The money vanished right away from upon the ground into the pockets, cigarettes hid in the capped palms.
   </p><p>However, the alarm was always false – the teachers turned to the toilet where there was a boarded cabin for Director and the teaching staff.
   </p><p>In just three games, I lost fifteen kopecks, that Mother gave me for a cabbage pirozhki from the school canteen. This was no wonder though because the <em>bitok</em> virtuosos were training their hands at home with their favorite <em>bitok</em> pieces and I had to hit with a borrowed one. Maybe so was even for the better – leaving no time for me to get addicted…
   </p><p>On my first day at school, Class Mistress, Albina Grigoryevna, planted me next to a skinny red-haired girl, Zoya Yemets. I never used Zoya’s inkpot, yet Sasha Dryga, a grown-up double repeater with a greasy forelock down to his eyes, resented my presence at her desk and after the classes he didn't omit informing me of the fact...
   </p><p>And on the way home I made friends with my classmate Vitya. His last name sounded a bit scary, yet it’s a commonplace one among the native Ukrainian family names – Skull. Our on-the-fly friendship had sound foundation though because we both were walking along one and the same Nezhin Street, and he also lived on it, only farther, next to the Nezhin Store which was halfway from any of the street’s ends.
   </p><p>The following day I asked Albina Grigoryevna for moving me to the last desk in the left row, to be seated next to Skull, because we were neighbors and could help each other with home assignments. She respected so weighty reasons and I left Zoya’s side.
   </p><p>The desk in front of me and Vitya was seated singly by Vadya Kubarev, which situation immediately gave rise to our  triple friendship.
     </p><p>The last names at school were, naturally, used by only teachers, while among the students Skull would surely turn Skully, Kubarev become Kuba and so forth.
     </p><p>What handle did I get? Goltz or Ogle? Neither. If your name happened to be “Sehrguey”, they did not bother about vivisecting the last name and everyone started to call you “Gray” by default…
     </p><p>Friendship is power. When the three of us were together, even Sasha Dryga refrained from bullying.
     </p><p>Friendship is knowledge. I shared the pieces of poetry never included in school curriculum but firmly memorized by all the boys at the Object, such as “To get insured from the cold…”, and “The light was burning in the pub…”, and “Vaniyka-Halooy went to the fair…” as well as other short but flowery instances of rhymed folklore.
     And in the context of cultural and philological exchange, my friends explained to me the meaning of popular Konotopian expressions like “Have you fled from Romny?” or “It’s time to pack you off to Romny.” As it turned out, the town of Romny, about seventy kilometers from Konotop, was the seat of Regional Psychiatric Hospital for nuts…</p>
