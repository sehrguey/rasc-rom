 <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
 <p>With the first non-combat mission accomplished, they collected us by the entrance to the Fourth Company barrack and  divided into three platoons, each under the command of a separate sergeant. The sergeants compiled lists of their commandos, checked them with the general list by the lieutenant and started training the newbies.
 In all the three platoons were drilled the same commands.
 </p><p>"Platoooon! Fall in!"
 </p><p>"Platoooon! Fall out!"
 </p><p>"Platoooon! Fall in!"
  </p><p>"Platoooon! Fall out!"
   </p><p>"Platoooon! Fall in!"
   </p><p>"Platoooon! Fall out!"
   </p><p>We executed the commands keeping our hunger in check by the wishful thinking because a small group of recruits had been already sent to the Canteen for laying tables with the midday meal.
 And finally, "Fall in for the meal!"
   </p><p>"Slow.. march!"
   </p><p>In contrast to the Club, where you had to climb three stairs in the porchway to the door, in the Canteen, on entering the door, you went three steps down into the spacious hall filled with two quads of tables separated by the central aisle.
   </p><p>On both sides of each table stood a bench  of solid timber painted brown allowing for ten men to sit in a row.
 The dark gray  floor of smoothly polished concrete endowed the hall with a bouncing hum, like in the waiting rooms of passenger stations at their busy hours.
</p><p>Along the whole left wall, two steps ran beneath the three consecutive windows to the rooms outside the hall. A wide uninterrupted  shelf-ledge of white-painted tin stretched under all the three windows.
 The first (and also the smallest) of the windows was the seat of Bread-Cutter already closed from within with its tin-clad shutter.
 The next one—wide and having no shutters—presented the view of the kitchen with the steam rising off the wide cylinders of nickel-plated cooking boilers, and a pair of soldier-cooks among them, in khaki trousers, slippers on bare feet, and tank tops under their half-unbuttoned  white jackets in the yellowish smears of grease smudges. One of the cooks had a white-cloth beret on his head.
 The last, also wide and shutterless, window connected to the Dishwashers' room filled with steam and noise of hot water bursting from several taps at once in the long tin trough full of heaps of used enamel cups and bowls, and aluminum spoons.
</p><p>The far blind wall opposite the entrance,  in a pragmatic dark-swamp-slime paint-coat, separated the Canteen from the Club. In the right wall high up above the floor, the row of wooden frames kept the panes of unhinged windows…
   </p><p>The white enamel bowls, arranged in two long rows along the table, marked the seating places on the benches put close by.
   Twenty aluminum spoons, studded with water drops, were piled in the center of the table for each eater to grab one. Next to the spoons, lay a heavy dipper accompanied with twenty enamel cups spruced up with combat scars from the pell-mell pileups in the Dishwashers' trough.
  Two and a half, multiply cross-sliced, loaves of "brick"-shaped brown bread on the crumpled aluminum tray provided also exactly twenty chunks...
   </p><p>The cooks began throwing five-liter enameled pots on the ledger-shelf of the dispenser window, issuing shrill indistinct yells. The first meal in the army began.
   </p><p>The borshch was red and scorching hot. It was brought in a pot from the dispenser window and ladled into the bowls with the dipper.
 Since through all of the dinner  each serviceman was to use just one and the same bowl, the borshch should be eaten to get the second course, or you had to refuse the first course at once and wait until the on-duty soldier brings the following pot with  barley porridge, more commonly handled <em>kirzookha.</em>
</p><div id="span"><p>(...take a look at the top  in army boots made of <em>kirza</em> [plagiarized English "kersey"], this artificial leather was invented as a war effort during the Russian-Japaneese war and though it did not prevent the defeat of the Russian Empire in that conflict yet for more than a hundred years it faithfully remained in both combatant and non-combatant service.
</p><p>  Now, if you ignore these deviating asides and carefully consider the fine pattern impressed into the surface layer  in the top  of boots at the Russian-Soviet-(once more)Russian armies  made  of the artificial <em>kirza </em>leather, you start to understand the accuracy of the unofficial term <em>kirzookha</em> traditionally used for the traditional meal of the barley porridge in all of the above-mentioned armies.
  No wonder, the considered likeness prompted servicemen on the doorsill of their hunger death to cook their boottops as it happened on the small barge that for 49 days became a plaything for storms in the Pacific before it was met by a US aircraft carrier off the coast of California. The Soviet sailors were proposed the political asylum in the United States  because the Cold War proclaimed by the British hereditary political star Churchill in the Fulton piece of his orations raged globally at that time.
</p><p>However, Sergeant Ziganshin recollected the beauty of both sunsets and dawns in his native Tatarstan steppe and refused. The rest three sailors followed the suit (being not Tatars though) and later all of them were awarded one of the higher orders in the Soviet Union after a proper check if they didn't become CIA agents while being fed up back to normal in the cornucopious State of California [only in mid-90's Askhat Ziganshin got rehabilitated from the alcoholic addiction caused by the never-subsiding under cover interrogations].
 </p><p>  All that happened in 1960 and gave birth to a popular folk-rock song running something like this:
 </p><figure><p class="centered2 ital bold">  Beware, guys!<br>
  Ziganshin's on the loot!<br>
  The  night before <br>
  He chomped his buddy's boot!
</p></figure><p>  Which is the oddest point in this whole story because at that period the USSR hadn't got any VIA yet...)
</p></div><p>The porridge was liquid too and as hot as the borshch.
    Compote poured into the cups from well-dented aluminum kettles, was not so hot, yet also liquid.
   The stunning din of bustle in a railway station served the background to munching and slurping. At times (not every day though) the peaceful symphony of animated feeding got pierced through with loud curses and dings of a cup hurled bouncing and spilling along the central aisle. Nothing to get jumpy about, the soldier noticed that his cup was leaking and expressed his indignation with the fact because by the long-established prison tradition using of impaired utensils was both the prerogative and mark of a <em>petukh,</em> aka faggot among the inmates.
 </p><p>On finishing the meal, the tools of personal saturation had to be taken to the Dishwashers' window and put in the appropriate piles or stacks on the shelf-ledge. As those accumulate, Dishwashers themselves would topple the heaps into the corresponding sections of the trough under the streams of steaming water from the taps.
   </p><p>Now we could leave the Canteen and return to the "training" barrack so as not to miss the next command to fall in…
   </p><p>The subsequent army experience proved that borshch was never to happen for breakfast or supper, those started immediately with<em> kirzookha,</em> and in the morning next to the bread on the tables they put a tray with 20 cubes (1" x 1" x 0.5") of yellow butter brought from the Bread-Cutter's window, which you spread on the bread with the   aluminum spoon handle picked up from the pile.
 If the butter was brought in one piece it was portioned by the most authoritative serviceman of those present at the table, with his spoon handle.
   </p><p>The piece of butter could also be reduced by a passer-by serviceman who started his army service a year and a half earlier, and now approached your table to reward himself for his combat merits. The lump sugar, brought for tea, would also do for one or another honored veteran…
   </p><p>On the whole, the ration was unpretentious, yet enough for to survive.
 In autumn it became even simpler – cabbage and water for the first course, cabbage and no water for the second, water and no cabbage for the third.
</p><p>On a seldom lucky day, you could detect a sliver of lard a-floating in your portion of the <em>kirzookha</em> porridge (the detachment had its pigsty, after all) but nothing beyond the lard.
</p><p>And on the Soviet holidays, they would even add  white buns for the morning tea…
</p><p>At first, I couldn't eat soldiers' food. Not that I was over-squeamish, but simply because no matter how hard I tried I still couldn't manage to stuff that ration into myself. It stubbornly stuck in the throat.
</p><p>At one of the meals, a soldier from the previous draft, seeing my diligent agony, laughed and explained, "No fear! You'll get used and start to <em>havvat</em> anything."
   He was right. The matter was that in the construction battalion they did not eat, but "havvat".
   </p><p>"The company went to <em>havvat </em>– catch on!"
   </p><p>"And what <em>havvage</em> is it today?"
   </p><p>As soon as I stopped eating and started <em>havvating,</em> everything fell into place. At times, I even <em>havvatted</em> an additional portion.
   </p><p>But that came later because if a soldier in his first half-year in the service (handled in that period "young", or "salaga", or "salabon") dared approach the dispenser window with the bowl in  hands, the cook, most likely, would feel lazy to splash into it a scoop of <em>havvage </em>and simply shriek instead, "Fuck you, <em>salabon</em>!"
 Not because of being a genetic misanthropist, but just aping the attitude he had suffered from when being a "young"  himself.
 However, he also might not start shrieking – you come across exceptions anywhere.
   </p><div id="span"><p>(...in his two years at the army service, a Soviet soldier ascended the hierarchical ladder of servicemanship.
   </p><p>In the first six months, he was a <em>salaga</em>, aka "young", aka "salabon".
   </p><p>For the next six months—after the following draft had brought in a new wave of <em>youngs</em>—he became a <em>dipper</em>.
   </p><p>One year of service and two younger drafts behind made him a <em>pheasant</em>.
   </p><p>For the concluding six months, with no old-timers above him, he was a <em>grandpa</em>.
   </p><p>And, at last, Minister of Defense of the USSR has signed the order on demobilization of the servicemen drafted two years ago, which act turns a <em>grandpa</em> into a <em>dembel </em>to be dismissed on the arrival of the new draftees.
   </p><p>The hierarchy terminology is not overly hieroglyphic.
   </p><p><em>Young</em> meant the youngest in the service.
   </p><p><em>Dippers</em> were entrusted with dealing the <em>havvage</em> out – for the <em>youngs</em> too early, for the senior servicemen below their status.
   </p><p><em>Pheasants</em> took in the width of their cotton pants to have them tight like sausage skin and began to stagger kinda bunch of dandies.
   </p><p><em>Grandpa</em> was antipodal to <em>young,</em> and <em>dembel</em> presented a nice abbreviation for "demobilization".
   </p><p>To go through that ladder you had to live two years...
   At the age of eighteen or twenty such quantity of time seems an eternity.
 </p><p>Besides, the quality of time in the army is unpredictable, some days fly by hardly having been started,  while others – vice versa,  you feel that no less than a week had passed already – but no! – it's still today.
   In the army, the amount of time of the latter sort prevails over that of the one mentioned first.
   </p><p>The most miserable lot was that of "dembels" who had pulled, and pushed, and dragged the un-embraceable lump of two years to the finish.
   </p><p>For them each hour became an eternity filled with soul trepidation, anxiety beyond any good riddance, disbelief that that was possible at all.
   </p><p>Soldiers from the lower rungs of the ladder tried to spur time employing for the purpose card calendars where all the twelve months of the year were printed on one side, while the backside called to keep money in the saving banks or fly by the Aeroflot airplanes.
   </p><p>They ruthlessly pricked each day lived through with a needle, one by one.
   The card calendars lost their glossy appeal, but when raised against the sky, they showed quads of pin-thick holes – one for a month lived through.
   </p><p>Such calendar-pricking calls for a disciplined unswerving mind and remarkable willpower.
 Not by a single <em>pheasant</em> have  ever I happened to see such a calendar. Eternity humbles  and crushes any high-and-mighty  pride...)</p>
