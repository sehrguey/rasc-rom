 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part two)<br>&nbsp;</h3>

  <p> There was a New Year dancing party held in the foyer of the New Building.
Eera and I were dancing there, and some teacher from the Biology Department could not keep back her delight,  she gleefully announced to us that we were created for each other. It's nice to be complimented that way, moreover, by a specialist versed in species.
But soon after, the zipper in my jeans blasted, and my sweater  was not long enough to hide the hole. So I tried to fasten the sweater hem to the jean's fly with the safety pin lent me by Slavik. However, it did not help to solve the situation, because the pinched down sweater began to look like a leotard on sub-deb gymnastics girls, besides, I did not care to be pricked into one or another of my private parts if the pin burst too.
There remained no other option but go to the Hosty and change my jeans.
Normally, I didn't keep spare clothes in my room but changed in Konotop at weekends. Yet, that was a special occasion and I had brought my dapper jeans for dancing at the party. The incident made me change back into shabbier, but sturdier ones.
</p><p>Upon returning to the foyer, I found Eera in eager conversation with some young buster. I did not like him right away, despite the fact that he turned some of her old acquaintances.
</p><p>Probably, I couldn't hide my dislike towards him and the feeling became reciprocal. The confrontation did not go over to active hostilities, but the voice timbers acquired menacing pitch.
At some point, I looked away from the jackass and caught a glimpse of Eera which deeply amazed me. She blossomed, she was happy! Never before I had ever seen so much joy in her eyes...
</p><p>On the way to her home, Eera kept picking holes in my reaction to an absolutely normal situation, and I half-heartedly defended myself, busy with storing in my head the new discovery.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...the highest bliss and most eagerly craved for moment in a female life arrives when two stag-males are going to clash their horns for her, the prize bitch.
</p><p>That's it.
You vigorously toil like f-f..er..I mean, flustered Pygmalion absorbed so deeply in turning your piece of art into living flesh, panting, drowning in the perspiration of relentless efforts and to what end all that, eh?!.
</p><p>O, fool! You’re slavering for an idle jerk popping up down the road to lap up the goodies of creation that cost you so many pains!
No, it’s anything but a fair play.
Where's the f-f..er..fundamental justice, eh?..)
</p></div><p>The New Year Eera met at the Hosty...
Before her arrival, I served a romantic table for two, a bottle of red wine next to an unlit candle and an open can of sprats in oily liquid. There still remained some time and I suddenly decided to prepare a surprise for her, or rather a New Year present...
</p><p>Since my getting interested in the topic, it was insistingly driven in to me that the longer, the better. To wit, the duration of having it indicates the quality of action.
The human race invented quite a few tricks for gaining upswing in quality. The simplest one is to kill a glass or two, I mean the standard Russian glass of 250 ml.
However, stepping on that path you need the right snack. Prosper Merimé, for example, was advocating for soup of cock combs for this particular purpose. I did not  have even lard.
</p><p>The austere circumstances called for finding other means or workarounds.
My personal experience in the brute facts of life prompted that of two go-rounds the second having a sex was always longer. Thus, I had no other choice but having a proactive sex.
</p><p>Very conveniently, Spotty was frisking about the hostel corridor, hither and thither, as if so too busy with her New Year Eve cares. Good timing.
I skipped discussing the reasons of my unexpected interest in her or clarifying that I needed nothing but mere technical assistance. Not that such frankness would hurt her in any way. The floozy had seen much more than I could imagine in the wildest dreams before she had to transfer to the Nezhin State Pedagogical Institute to avoid being sent down from the University of Kiev for grossly unleashed fucking and sucking.
Possibly, there were other reasons too, because she casually mentioned that her husband did not wear anything under his jeans at all. Well, I dunno, but for me, a common, timorous, unspoiled, lad from the Settlement, the like extravagances seemed way too deep…
</p><p>The technical assistance was applied in a neutral, of course, room and in a distanced, orogenital way. With the business-like  warning not to crumple her breasts, where there were no  erogenous zones, she flung my jeans open,  zapped  my cock out and went down on it. The pecker met the attacking force with brave unyielding hardon which attitude was retained through all of the procedure. Regrettably so... </p><p>Time went on, she obviously ran out of her store of tricks in giving head but I still couldn’t cum. The situation more and more  acquired the air of monotony and even considering the ringlets of her hair the color of raven's wing, and the glasses which she never took off, was of no help. And when there started to surface superfluous analogies and uncalled-for reminiscences  of a dark alley in the park of Stavropol, I beat a retreat which is not an easy maneuver with a stubborn stalwart  at presenting arms in the leg of your jeans.
</p><p>Still and all, what a smart hell of a subtle plan it was! The second to none willingness for genuine self-sacrifice!  A knightly deed, if you find a second to consider it with sufficient introspection... Catering a blow job to Spotty, who had no idea of whereabouts of those f-f…er...frigging erogenous zones of hers. A selflessly chivalrous  readiness for anything just to please your beloved! If it was not an irrefutable example of devoted love and tender care, I know of nothing else that could be…
</p><p>Nevertheless, I did not disclose to Eera what namely I had to  get through just to make her feel good. Because I never was keen on flashing my positive aspects and advertising my noble deeds overmuchly...
Later on, that New Year night, when Eera and I sat up at the table again, wrapped in bedsheets like Romans in their togas, Spotty walked by the door opened to the corridor.
Out there, with gleeful vehemence, those who met the New Year in the hostel congratulated each other.
</p><p>Spotty politely knocked on the door jamb, was invited to the table, treated to wine and allowed to ask Eera about her life circumstances.
Eera started to drive a fool to her, like, she was a married woman but her husband being a geologist seldom came home.
Having just recently moved from Kiev to Nezhin, Spotty believed anything driven to her which made us laugh immoderately.
</p><p>The haughty, naive Romans in those loose togas, we were making fun of gullible Spotty without realizing that any jest was the truth which just needed some time to mature…
</p><p>After the winter examination session, Eera and I went to Borzna for the wedding of her course-mate Vera to her solid groom in the rank of Major.
Unlike the wedding of my course-mate two years before in the same Borzna town, the celebration was not a <em>khutta </em>affair but took place in the large café-canteen on the main square of that district center, and lasted for two days.
</p><p>After the first day, Eera and I spent the night in a small <em>khutta</em> among the snow-filled vegetable gardens on the outskirts.
The <em>khutta</em> owner, a distant relative of Vera, was told that Eera and I were a married couple, newlywed, and she, after having her fill at the wedding table, went to sleep over at some other relative's, because her place was a single room with a whitewashed oven, a table, a chair, and a bed.
The bed stood by the wide windowsill with the sharply outlined black shadow of the lattice, lightened from outside by the full moon, whose beams set a-gleaming the glass walls in the empty three-liter jar left on the same shadow-crossed sill.
</p><p>I liked everything there, and the crusty earth floor made of firm, washed-down, clay, and the bed with boards in place of the mesh, and the hay-stuffed mattress...
It's highly unlikely that the mistress believed in our being a husband and wife because during the wedding feast I a couple of times caught her gaze, both encouraging and gruffly sneering, from behind the table where she sat among the elderly women in their Sunday best black padded jackets, or in black plush coats with thick plaid kerchiefs spread loosely over their shoulders…
</p><p>We threw our clothes off on the chair and ascended to the matrimonial bed as it was a century and centuries before in those same<em> khuttas </em>lost among those same snowdrifts.
The moon reluctantly rose up above the window frame and could no longer follow the merrymaking couple of newlyweds, pressing hay at the alternate ends of the bed rooted in the earth floor of the unchanging <em>khutta</em>…
</p><p>On the second day, Eera grew silly jealous when I was called out from the wedding hall by a local beauty. I did not really get it what's what as in the din of celebration Vera's brother, Mozart by his handle, shouted into my ear the unintelligible message.</p><p>
Leaving the café-canteen, I went to the half-dark backyard where a beautiful, in general, girl was staging a pathetic hysteria on the trampled snow, pinioned by two girlfriends, all the trinity in light festive dresses.
A group of young spectators, who came out to air themselves, crowded by with exhortations to her and adviсes to the girls gripping her arms.
Without the slightest participation in the amateur show, I turned to leave and met the unforgiving stare of Eera. Back at the table, I had a hard time convincing her that I had nothing to do with the vagaries of tipsy mantrap.
</p><p>I was supported by Valentina, a female of the most remarkable physique, who sat next to Eera. Farther on, there was seated an insignificant, on the background of her mighty forms, Armenian.
</p><p>His Armenian identity was revealed when he was giving the three of us a ride through the early night...
On the street leading to the Moscow highway, the big Valentina told him to slow down, and left the Zhiguli to yell at Tolik, her fifth-grader son. The boy was replying to his mother in pure Ukrainian, and I felt somehow knocked out of a rut by the winter snow all around so sharply discordant to the boy's Negro face.
</p><p>Later, Eera told me that Valentina had born Tolik after working at a canteen in Kiev, or maybe she found that job after the delivery, I'm not quite sure on that point because it’s where things get always somewhat messy, I mean them those canteens.
</p><p>Valentina's current life partner of an Armenian was not messing around with the instance of upbringing.
We rode along the highway, and after a couple of kilometers stopped on the roadside snow.
The driver turned on the tape-recorder and took out a bottle of foil-necked champagne.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...the beauty of Armenian music does not open to listeners right away.
At that time it was still incomprehensible to me but I kept patient – he, who gives a ride, orders the music...)
</p></div><p>A patrol car stopped on the road, and two militiamen in greatcoats and, despite the winter, forage caps approached the Zhiguli. The Armenian stepped out to negotiate and make it clear that everything was safely controlled.
In the meantime, Valentina started to resent that I and Eera were staying in a so shabby <em>khutta,</em> and undertook to bring her indignation to the bride's parents, who were some kind of her relatives.
As a result, the second night we spent in a large, freshly renovated house in the well-to-do part of Borzna.
</p><p>The moon could not peep into our room there, only a dim reflection of the moonlight made its way to us through the glazed door of the adjacent veranda.
The bed frame was way too creaky, so the mattress had to be thrown on the paint-coated floorboards.
Not too bad, in general, but I liked it better in the shabby <em>khutta</em>…</p>
