<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Parade of Planets<br>&nbsp;</h3>



  <p>On the Day D, aka my departure day, everything hung on a thread, more precisely, on a single cobweb fiber. I got it at once on entering the staircase-entrance vestibule to spark a blunt because I never smoked in the apartment, not even vanilla cigarettes. The cobweb thread hung from the upper crossbar in the cracked entrance-door frame, stretched tautly downward by the weight of a burned match dangling from its end...
  How long could it last?.
</p><p>It was I, who always stuffed burned matches up in the gap between the frame-top and the whitewashed plaster on the wall because there was no trash bin in the staircase-entrance vestibule.
  After Tonya's toddler son exposed my connection with cannabis, I did not care what might be sniffed out by the passers-by in the smoke I left in the vestibule...
  Would the cobweb thread hold on until I was away?.
</p><p>I looked  from the shade in the staircase-entrance out into the yard. A squadron  of black ravens coasted lowly through the heat-melted sky. Heading north-east, they did not move their wings—the heat made all of them too reluctant to make even the slightest effort—the feathers at their wing-tips stuck kinda stilled spikes harrowing the hot breeze...
  Could I get through?.
  </p><p>Eera saw me to the station.
  When we were getting on a bus, from a balcony in the neighboring five-story block Alla Pugacheva sobbed up after me in her latest hit:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"Please, come back for at least a day!.."
</p><p>I did not have much luggage – a briefcase with a book of stories by W. S. Maugham in English (soft pink cover, Moscow publishing house "The Enlightenment"), the Hornby's Learners' Dictionary, a thin 12-leaf copy-book with a stub at translation of "The Rain" story by Maugham (4 pages of a rough pencil draft with manifold corrections), the employment history book (the first entry made on September 13, 1971, at Konotop Locomotive and Car Repair Plant), the passport, the military ID, and shaving accessories.
</p><p>The briefcase had a companion of the blue sports-bag with a shoulder strap, containing a change of underpants, two tank tops, a pair of shirts, jeans, and the geologist jacket, sewn by my mother of green tarpaulin...
  Boarding the local train, I threw them onto the car-long rack of thin tubes running above the windows and went back to the platform.
  </p><p>Eera was nervous that the doors would slam shut and the train leave without me. I climbed up one step to the car vestibule and stood there, holding a grip on the nickel-plated vertical railing, "I’ve left something on the windowsill, let it be there till I'm back."
  </p><p>"What's that?"
  </p><p>"Look for yourself. I'll be back exactly in a month."
  </p><p>"Call at once as you've arrived!"
</p><p>  It was the last car on the train.
  An old woman ran up along the platform. She asked something but I neither listened nor wanted to, I was looking at Eera until the speakers in the car shouted, "Beware! The doors are shutting!" And they cut me off her.
</p><p>  The electric train pulled and, gaining the speed, rumbled along the rails in the direction of Kiev…
  </p><p>The night before, I went out shopping together with Eera.
The department store was locked already, but the glazed stall by its side still worked.
  From the middle-aged gypsy woman inside it, I bought a new safety razor, a shaving brush, a stand-up mirror, and two handkerchiefs with a series of  pin-thick  blue wavy lines printed across their fields and leaving out only thin circular  frames in the center.
  Both size and looks of the handkerchiefs were quite alike except for the pictures inside those frames – a small sailing boat in one, a neat blue anchor in the other.
</p><p>In my pocket, I was carrying away the one with the sailing boat, its counterpart with the anchor was left on the windowsill. Coming back, I would put their circles to each other, the boat to the anchor. It would be the ritual of return…
</p><p>And pretty late at night, my mother-in-law suddenly freaked out and started anxiously persuade me there was no need to go anywhere, and it was still possible to return the train ticket Kiev-Odessa to the booking ticket-office.
  </p><p>I thought I was going to lose it – what ticket return, on earth?
  </p><p>Eera and Tonya also joined the conversation, only the father-in-law was out, called to the situation at the Bakery Plant.
  </p><p>Staring at the table’s oilcloth,  Gaina Mikhailovna was mumbling about a somewhat too complicated period, so that even Ivan couldn't get through...
  </p><p>A week before, Tonya's husband Ivan left for the Transcarpathia, yet without ever reaching there, he returned from Kiev a day later—I couldn't get it why—and now he was all the time sitting away in the bedroom with the children of their family.
  </p><p>By that time, I had already apprehended, that the whole world was in the state of tumultous fracas, of some unceasing battle in progress – but who against who? That was some question! Because all of that went on under wraps leaving the surface covered by the conventional  layer of casual life. Still, through occasional rinds and gaps in the disguise, there at times glimpsed certain inconsistencies, secret signs, and I
  already started to understand that the true reality contained something surpassing the customary limits of commonplace views we were brought up to keep to, and those my guesses were affirmed by frequent instances when people let  things out.
</p><p>Was I sure they were exactly people? Well, I did not have another name for them...
  Letting out? What namely? What about?. About things that did not belong to the life which we were accustomed to.
</p><p>...Ivan unable to get through...(repealed on his emissary mission)...and whose side are you on?. (the fire at the Bakery Plant just an episode in the universal battle)...
</p><p>I had to find the ways and means for collecting the strewn puzzle pieces of concomitant reality, turn them into some wieldy thing and not get lost amidst the chance hints of recondite raw truth.
  Who's for who? Who's against who?.
</p><p>A thunderstorm broke behind the black window in the living room. The ramble of falling water outside got time and again cut through with the thunderclaps slashed by the flicker of blinding flashes. A pillar of enormously white light struck the transformer box in the yard. And the pitch-black darkness engulfed all around.
</p><p>Tonya groped her way to their bedroom to calm down the children and Ivan. When she came back with a burning candle, I saw in its feeble light that I was talking to Mothers. Those very Mothers mentioned, in all too cautious, cut-and-run, manner by Goethe...
   Three Mothers  were they: the old  but mighty, the middle, and the beginner – Eera. She was not my ally, she was one of them. I needed to persuade them, otherwise, nothing would come out.
</p><p>  With the storm raging outside, behind the blinking candle reflection in the panes of black glass, I still managed to get their go-ahead...
  In conclusion, their eldest, the leader said, "If something goes completely awry...in a hopeless, extreme, situation...turn to the very Head..."
  </p><p>At night I had a prophecy dream...
  I lay on a gurney, trying to become inconspicuous in the cold and dim fluorescent light flooding from everywhere through the pale gray, semi-translucent, ceiling and walls, so as not allow for the slightest sliver of a shadow. A group of someones in white robes stood all about me. The one standing out of view, behind my head, asserted, "If not for the fat, it still might come out..." Even without seeing, I knew that the one in the white who pronounced that was also me.
  </p><p>With a furtive glance from under my half-closed eyelids at the stomach of me lying raw upon the gurney, I saw through the sheer skin a thin yellowish layer, probably, the fat he was talking about…
  </p><p>I went out into the train car vestibule and sparked. Through the sky  in the automatic doors' dusty glass, a flock of seahorses floated with their tails curled up under the bellies. Lined by their height, from the bigger to the smaller, they were also fond of a system, like the lost figurines of white elephants. The train hurriedly raced ahead, yet couldn't escape their formation...
  </p><p>A man entered the vestibule with a dangling row of medals on his civilian jacket breast. A war veteran; here's the one who once knew who's for who, who's against who.
  </p><p>We shot the breeze for a while without advancing any particular line of thought until at one of the stops, a man with a bundle of long thin planks in his hands stepped in from the platform. He carried his load between us two and went on into the car.
  The veteran's eyes filled with fright staring into the upper corner behind me. I knew that there was nothing there, but since he saw it, then there it was.
  </p><p>And I also went into the car, to the window under the rack carrying my things, because Kiev was running towards our train…
  </p><p>At the station, I took my luggage to the cool and huge underground checkroom hall. Then I came back up to the surface of the station square in whose right corner I slipped through the slight passage leading to the steep and long stair flights that descended to the canteen once shown to me and Olga by Lekha Kuzko.
  </p><p>At the bottom of stairs, I sparked and went on, but had to stop smoking, when a platoon of militiamen poured out of the canteen and marched towards me along the sidewalk, so that I had to pad through their ranks, with a smoldering blunt between my fingers…
  </p><p>From the canteen, I returned to the station and took a walk-round. There were not so many glass-eyed as on the night watch at the Nezhin station, probably, because of the different time of day. Still, there were some and at my approach, they hurriedly pretended that they were there just so, kinda ornery passengers.
  </p><p>I went up to the third floor where there was the mother-and-child room and explained to the watchwoman that in a month I would be passing their station together with my wife and baby daughter, and now I dropped in to check the conditions. Well, in general, rather a clean corridor, thank you.
  </p><p>Near the toilet rooms on the first floor, a young militiaman with a black eye of deep purple hue took pains to avoid the least eye contact with me, although both of us perfectly knew that his black eye came from my walking through their formation and that he, who had suffered in the universal battle, would not forgive me that.
  </p><p>Then, for quite a stretch, I stood in the waiting hall on the second floor, in front of the huge news stall counter keeping heaps of diverse newspapers, magazines, postal envelopes. But all that time I looked at just one postcard with the bluest blue sky in its picture.
  </p><p>It was a long wait until there at last sounded footsteps behind me, hardly audible in the joint buzz of the crowd filling the hall...
  My eyes stayed fixed at the picture. The footsteps stopped. A copper coin the size of an eye iris fell from behind my back onto the blue in the postcard. Only then I turned and went away without ever looking back – from that moment on no casual genes would ever be able to change the color of your eyes.
  </p><p>And only then it was, that the station loudspeakers' call broke through to me:
  </p><p>"The train Kiev-Odessa departs from the third platform. We ask escorting citizens to leave the cars."</p>
