<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Ivory Tower<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>
The supply of foraged potatoes could see through the whole week, however,  potatoes alone somehow did not satiate, even if sprinkled with the salt found in the common kitchen...
The artist noticed when in the Red Corner room I lifted a dried bread roll, forgotten by someone on a windowsill, and ate it, hiding in my fist.
He reported the incident to the head of the personnel department.
</p><p>The grumpy geezer, in the unvarying mask of disdain on the face, came to Red Corner, already empty of the business trippers of whom I was the last one, and demanded explanations for so strange an action.
</p><p>The money was lost from my bag.
</p><p>Stolen? Who?
</p><p>I knew nothing. There had been ten rubles which were there no more.
</p><p>The mask twitched in disgust and he walked out.
Soon, I was summoned to his office where he informed me that my business trip papers  would be stamped for the entire stretch (there still remained  three more days) but I had to perform an urgent work: a KAMAZ truck had dumped its load of sand at a wrong place in the yard, so the sand had to be moved, yet not by a bulldozer whose caterpillars would mangle the fresh asphalt.
</p><p>It took me two or three hours to shovel the sand behind the kinda screen of too small pots with the doomed fir-tree babies.
I was paid ten rubles for the job, which money I immediately received from the cashier in the accountancy office.
 The local train ticket to Konotop was four rubles plus. So I went to a grocery store, bought a bottle of vodka, transparent as a tear of separation, something there for a snack, and returned to the Red Corner room.
Together with the artist, we drank that vodka for the success of the poetry collection whose pages had to be turned backward…
</p><p>The overhaul at the Konotop recycle factory was headed by Yura, one of the three workmen at the unit.
He loved to laugh and did it ably, exposing the fixture of white metal on his fang. In the white-and-black films they usually portrayed Komsomol leaders looking like him and only the fix did not fit the image.
</p><p>The second overhauler was Arsen, cross-eyed, but not too much so. He put on the airs of a dignified aqsaqal, despite his young age. The reason for his tremendous pride was having the son who reached the age of two years already.
</p><p>  I hit it off with Arsen, but Yura with his stalking horse of laughter kept trying hard to crush me, most likely, because of his aversion to my higher education.
I did not tell anyone about the fact, but those four years were recorded in my workbook now kept in the personnel department of the factory, and Yura spent lots of time in the administration barrack, readily laughing along with everyone there.
The main impediment to establishing friendly relations between us two were my quotations as well as sharing news from <em>Morning Star</em>.
Arsen, for his part, tried his best to pacify our feud.
</p><p>Once talking to Arsen, I cited certain lines from the work of Karl Marx <em>On the Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State.</em>
</p><div id="span"><p>(...well, yes, Frederick Engels is commonly considered  the author of that work, however, Fritz published it after his dear friend Karl  passed away already, giving his buddy opportunity to rummage through his archives and works in progress not seen yet through the press.
Probably, Engels, like the blond from Southern Ukraine found expropriation of the absent justifiable by  inconveniences suffered previously.
</p><p>Anyway, he openhandedly supported Karl, his wife, and their six kids  with the money of his father, also Fritz...)
</p></div><p>I did not draw Arsen's attention to all those details, keeping down to a short quotation from the work itself.
Yura, who happened about, suddenly snapped in  demanding that I never ever dare start provocative talks like this in his presence because he was a communist and knew where to give a phone call on statements of that kind.
</p><p>For the first time in our clashes, the last word remained by him. He dumbfounded me with his threat to halloo the KGB at the founders of Marxism-Leninism. And that's no fun, they would easily run them down, for all I know...
</p><p>Another time, I was depicting to Arsen the Wagner's ballet about Scottish witches which I attended during the business trip to Kiev.
Dancing a solo dance, one of the hexes stumbled and with a wooden knock fell flat onto the stage floor.
</p><p>"Ha-ha-ha!" cheerfully reacted Yura on his visit to the overhaul room from the administration barrack.
</p><p>"And imagine, Arsen, in the whole hall there was not a single jerk to laugh at her. She got up and danced on, showed her high mettle, you know."
</p><p>And Yura also showed that it was not in vain that he spent so much time by the administration. As a result, I was transferred to the factory’s production section, to embrace the position of a presser…
</p><p>What, actually, was Rags? It served a place where freight cars were bringing rubbish sorted at garbage dumps. Discarded dreck clothing for the most part, as well as waste paper.
</p><p>Women from the nearby village of Popovka dissected the tatters with the howling disks of their machine tools and sorted the rugs again into soft mounds on the floor in the aisle between their workplaces – cotton tatters, knitted rags, artificial fur collars from winter coats, etc.
</p><p>Day after day they stood in front of their machine tools in dusty <em>spetzovka</em> garbs with dangling clusters of safety pins on their chest, which they detected and pulled out from fabrics so that the steely trifles did not damage the disk. Such grapes of pins made them evil-eye-proof foever...
</p><p>Time and again, two loaders approached those rag mounds with a deep box on long poles, like a sedan chair. Their faces were wrapped with bandannas, in the  style of bank robbers, so as not to inhale the dense clouds of dust hanging around the machine tools.
They piled rags high into their box and carried to the neighboring pressing section, pacing in a precipitated half-trot. That jogging gait was dictated by the weight of the load.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...once or twice I replaced someone of the missing loaders but was not able to do more than a couple of goes.
</p><p>"Sehryoga! You must be relaxed when carrying. Relax!"
</p><p>Yet even after that instruction, I could not reach relaxation  with the long pole-handles slipping slowly, unlocking by their unsustainable weight my fingers  strained in a vain grip...)
</p></div><p>The press was also a box but it had a door and no poles because it stood on the floor, anchored to its place.
With the door open, you needed, first of all, to put over the box bottom two thin and narrow metal strips, aka <em>shinka</em>, leaving their ends out of the box.
Then you had to line the box from inside with a couple of throwaway burlap sacks and lock the door with a hook outside.
After stuffing the box with the trash brought by the loaders, you hit one of the three buttons on the press side. The electric motor, fixed atop the press shield over the box, started to creak and howl, and crept down the shaft, pushing the shield also down.
It pressed the trash towards the bottom as deep as it could. When the pitch of the motor howling rose to whine, it meant the motor had done all it could and didn't have power to squeeze any firmer.
At that point, you hit the "stop" button and then the button "up". The shield with the motor started the reverse creeping, up the shaft.
Those ups and downs, the press executed really slowly.
</p><p>Then you filled the space produced in the box by the shield's cyclic travel, stuffing in additional armfuls of trash because the readied bale should weigh about 60 kg.
After the third going down, the shield was stopped to keep all that in place while you tied tightly the ends of<em> shinka</em> about the produced, roughly cubic, bale. There remained only to send the shield up and roll the readied bale out of the box. The farther away you rolled it over the floor the better, it wouldn’t now be in the way of the upcoming bales.
</p><p>About the press, there gradually accumulated a flock of bales and then Misha the loader came with a two-wheel barrow.
He shoved the bottom shelf of the barrow under the bale and yanked the handles toward himself. The bale lay upon the handles, supported with the shelf from behind, and Misha dragged the barrow to the exit from the pressing section.
</p><p>Near the exit gate, there stood the booth of Valya the weigher, with a large luggage scales next to it.
Misha toppled the bale onto the scales and, having dipped a short stick into a tin can with red  paint, wrote on the burlap wrapping of the bale figures of its weight, which Valya yelled to him through the glass of her booth because Misha was old and half deaf.
Then he dumped the bale from the scales, heaved it onto his two-wheel barrow again, and rolled it out of the pressing section into the open air, and there along the path of crippled concrete into the hangar for the finished product…
</p><p>When an empty railway freight car came to the dead-end track by the hangar, the team of hangar loaders stacked the bales into the car and it was driven away, no matter where, probably, to some factories for further processing of recyclables...
</p><p>In the pressing section, there was only one window crusted with the dust accumulated there from the period of the First Five-Year Plan.
The illumination was served by  dim yellowish bulbs, one over each of the four presses.
True, one of them did not work, but for the two workers in the section, the remaining three were enough.
</p><p>The production norm for a presser was thirty-two bales per shift.
I hardly turned them out during the working day, while the other presser, another Misha, who lived with Valya the bale weigher, would have finished the norm ahead of time and left, whistling haphazard airs.
He was more experienced presser and did not put excessive quantities of rags into the press box, while my bales showed abnormal overweight.
 Misha the loader would shake his deaf head disapprovingly, scribbling with the dipped stick "78" or "83" on the bales of my production.
Then he, with a grunt, heaved the bale onto the barrow and dragged it out, because he was a strong old man.
He was silent by nature and never reprove me.
But I felt guilty all the same because I could not catch the hang of guessing the weight of the rags stuffed into the press box…
</p><p>Apart from the midday break, there were two more half-hour breaks, just for having rest. We spent them in the common large room with lockers alongside two of its walls.
In the wall opposite the door, there were two windows large enough to make the room light because the dust stuck to them was not quite  opaque.
Four square tables with white plastic-cover  tops were put in a close row under the windows, forming one common table for the midday meal, with long plank benches along its sides.
That was the locker room of pressers and loaders who changed their clothes there. However, in the midday break, the Popovka women also came in because at theirs there was not a table to have a meal at.
</p><p>I did not  <em>havvat </em>there. For the midday meal, I traveled to the canteen of the "Motordetail" plant...
Crossing the railway track, I went over the field and took the turn beyond the city limit into the forest belt to follow the trail there to the terminal of streetcar 1, opposite the plant check-entrance. The whole journey took fifteen minutes.
</p><p>It was a very modern plant, and through the glass walls of the canteen on the second floor, there opened the view on the field from where I was coming. And there were no problems at the check-entrance, anyone in a<em> spetzovka</em> was considered a workman at the plant.
The <em>havvage</em> portions at the canteen were small but cheap, and for a couple of hours after you did not feel hungry.
</p><p>Sometimes, the bale weigher Valya ordered to bring her a custard cake from the canteen.
On the way back, when crossing the railway track in front of pulled up locomotives in the head of their freight trains  waiting for "the green" to pass through the Konotop junction, I tried to bribe the locomotives with the cake wrapped in a piece of paper.
They had such good-natured faces with beards in red paint coat, like the image in the sail of the Kon-Tiki raft. But they remained incorruptible.
</p><p>“Well, as you please, then!" and I was taking the cake to the bale weigher Valya… </p>
