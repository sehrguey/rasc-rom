<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Birchbark Sketches<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I didn’t go counter the route which two days earlier brought me to the famous tree. Instead, my intention was to follow the ridge of the <em>toombs</em> (so in Karabakh they call the rounded mountains stretching in wavy chains, under the blanket of grass and woods, to tell them from giant <em> lehrs </em>  pricking  the sky with their raw rocky peaks) by which stratagem I would bypass climbing all the way down to the valley of Karmir-Bazaar and trudging back up the highway to the pass in the vicinity of the Sarushen village.
</p><p>That’s why I took a well-neigh indiscernible trail tilting up the steep to the right. I did not know whether my plan was feasible at all but if there’s a trail it would eventually bring you someplace, right? And I walked on along it, inhaling sweet fragrance from the infinite varieties of mountain verdure, admiring the fixed waves of merrily green <em> toombs</em> flooded with the sunshine, looking forward to the delight from the breathtaking view which would unfurl from atop the ridge…
</p><p>And it turned out just so—a view surpassing the most dainty epithets by Bunin-and-Turgenev as well as the subtlest brush strokes in Ayvazovsky-and-Sarian’s pictures—and against that terrific background, the trail flowed into a narrow road coming up from nowhere to the next  <em> toomb</em> from whose wood, there were descending, dwindled to specks by the distance, a couple of horses, two men, and a dog.
</p><p>We met in ten minutes. The horses dragged three-to-four-meter-long trunks of young trees cinched with their thicker ends onto the backs of beasts of burden; the loose, peeled of bark, tops were scratching against the scorched road. Two boys and a dog escorted the firewood for keeping their homes warm next winter.
</p><p>Entering the wood, I met another party of loggers; they were three horses, and three men, and no dog. We exchanged greetings and I asked if there was a way to reach Sarushen going along the chain of <em> toombs</em> .
</p><p>The woodchopper in a sun-bleached red shirt and with the skin in his face tight as a drum to expose the detailed structure of his skull, replied that he had heard of such a trail but never went along it, and that after another three hundred meters I would meet a one-eyed old man cutting wood up there, who should certainly know.
</p><p>I walked as far as I was told to, then another three or five hundred meters, but never heard an ax; the old man was, probably, enjoying a snack break with a good smoke and sound nap...
</p><p>Before reaching the top of the <em> toomb</em>, the road split into multiple paths. I picked the one which looked wider but it soon gave out and disappeared completely. There remained just an untrodden mountain wood around, where instead of walking you have to climb grabbing at the tree trunks; a pretty tiring exercise, to be honest. Without climbing towards the summit, I kept moving around it, looking for a passage to the next <em> toomb</em> in the ridge.
</p><p>Suddenly, there came the feeling of some odd change. The sounds of the summer wood died away and the daylight got dimmed into a weird twilight erasing the sunlight spots between the bushes and on the tree trunks. A flash-mob of clouds in the sky?
</p><p>Looking around, I got it – instead of lofty giants blended with diverse undergrowth I was surrounded by frequent trunks of peers whose crowns interlocked at four to five meters above the ground into a dense mass of foliage impenetrable for the sun, and it was their joint shade that filled the air with the uncanny touch.
</p><p>Something made me look back, to an eye contact with the intent stare of a beast. A jackal? Dog?
…ah, none…look at this brush of a tail…a fox, to be sure…or maybe a vixen…clearly, a young one, never met hunters yet…
</p><p>“Hi, Fox. I’m not Prince. I am not young. Go your way.”
</p><p>I moved on, dodging the long web-threads, bypassing or, at times, scrambling through the prickly brier; the fox followed. Who invented the bullshit as if animals cannot withstand your fixed look and have to turn their eyes away? Faking quack!.
</p><p>And so  went we on. Occasionally, I addressed him with one or another conversational clue but he never picked gossip. At one point, I took off my haversack and opened it to fetch and throw him a piece of bread.
</p><p>At first, he didn’t seem to know how to approach it, but then ate, without taking his vigilant sight off me. Considering the donor as a potential prey? Don’t hurry, schemer…
And only when between the trees ahead there stretched a sunlit clearing, he began to cast skulking looks behind himself and soon blend into the woodwork. Fare thee well, Young Fox from the young forest…
</p><p>I went out into the clearing to realize that I had almost completed a rough circle about the summit without finding the passage to the next <em>toomb</em>. A couple of decayed roofs peeped from under the distant cliffs. Enough was enough and, fed up with the search for a supposed trail along the ridge, I switched over to looking for a possibility of climbing down to the ghost village of Skhtorashen.
</p><p>The steep footpath soon showed up and brought me to a deserted mulberry orchard from where I proceeded to the village spring of delicious water, far more superb to that by the long-liver sycamore.
</p><p>Then I walked a thirty-meter-long street of two or three houses lost under the vigorous growth of blackberry bushes. The raggedly cobbled street changed abruptly for a barely discernible trail tilting down the slope which faced the Karmir-Bazaar valley.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…the village of Skhtorashen was deserted before the Karabakh war, that’s why the houses were not burned down and still had their rotten roofs in place.
</p><p>The village, like many other ones, got killed by the dimwit decision of the Soviet leadership on the resettlement of population from high mountainous areas to lower places. The USSR, over its seventies at that time, was sinking into senile dotage because of political systems tend to follow the life circle of man, their creator.
</p><p>Servile authorities of the then Mountainous Karabakh Autonomous Region, along with the like polities in other Caucasian regions obeyed loose-brain Big Brother’s injunction and finished off more than one village.
</p><p>I mean, with all due respect to septuagenarians I’d rather skip their venerable funny club…)
</p></div><p>On the way down the slope, as an incurable bolshy, I made two more attempts at finding at least a minor shortcuts, yet the deviations were blocked by deep gorges and sheer cliffs, so the highway met me exactly where I left it two days before, near “The Old Sycamore Diner”.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…gently is a docile kid led ahead by fate, while stubborn brats are dragged along gripped at their forelock to unavoidably get to their destination…)
</p></div><p>After several turns of the smooth serpentine, the highway took a beeline to the pass out from the wide valley of Karmir-Bazaar.
</p><p>I trudged along the roadside through both repulsive and fetching stench of the sun-thawed asphalt. Panting, sweating, plodding ahead, I more and more often changed the position of the haversack straps on my shoulders, but they dug into the flesh anyplace and hurt to the very bone.
</p><p>The salty sweat ate into my eyes that ceased joyous frisking around the beautiful views and toiled uphill in a dull weary gaze at the rough asphalt under the shabby army boots stomping my shadow, which began to gradually grow longer.
</p><p>And yet, at times my eyes took the liberty of casting wishful glances up seeking some shady tree near the highway, though I knew perfectly well there was not a single such one all the way up to the pass top.
</p><p>Once or twice, I left the asphalt to slacken thirst with blackberries from the bushes down the road shoulder, but it seemed this year we are facing the blackberry crop failure or it was the stretch of barren bushes... And again me heavy boots were tramping uphill along with the relentless tilt…
</p><p>To become a skillful seer, don’t look for a better coach than mountains... And when the endless straight ascend of the highway reached the pass top to change from that point into horizontal bends and twists dictated by the relief of the <em>toombs </em>outside the valley, I could predict, and pretty accurately too, that half an hour later the already indiscernible (if watched from this here position) speck of me would be taking the indiscernible turn over the most far off slope of that distant <em>toomb </em>and, after ten-to-fifteen-minute walk, I would leave the highway before reaching the Sarushen village, and follow the dirt road tilting down to the bottom of the Varanda River valley. And there it would be really nice, with lots of shade under the trees, and the spring of cool water running from the rocky river bank…
</p><p>All happened exactly as foretold, and when the dirt road got down to the shallow ford across the gravel-filled riverbed before the steep rise to the village of Sarkissashen, I parted with it and went along the river through the live tunnel in a hazel thicket that led to the wide-open space with a narrow and unusually level field stretching alongside the foot of the giant <em>toomb </em>on the opposite bank.
</p><p>Try to imagine a football field put sloping upright, and overgrown with broad-leaf wood up to the very top of that wheeling stadium. Because of the <em>toomb’s</em> rampant steepness, the tree crowns do not screen each other but succeed, climbing higher and higher, and each of them shimmers with its own, a little bit different, shade of green. Can you imagine all that?
</p><p>If so, then you can easily see me as well on this riverbank, stretched on my back under a huge walnut tree, on the thick mat of moldered foliage from the years past, brittle, soft, dried out.
</p><p>Here am I to enjoy the orgy of the upward stream of green running over the<em> toomb</em> across the river, and to relish the blue of the sky above, and admire the canopy of broad walnut leaves sun-bathing in the light breeze over my head.
</p><p>Ho-ho! It’s damn good to be alive, lying like that, thinking about this or that, or nothing. The only discordant note is the absence of anyone who I could share all this beauty with.
</p><p>Whoops! Forget, cut this one out… I’ve got used already that the moments of such delight happen only with nobody around… Yet, it’s never overmuch to make sure of keeping megalomania tight in check, neither to take things for granted, like, the more space is forked out to one person, the higher is their position…
</p><p>Once upon a time, I was flipping through a discarded relic of a glossy magazine in German. The feature article in it was all about a certain Hoheit Herzog, the owner of a giant chemical concern.
</p><p>In short, he’s one of those Highnesses whose stance is above the political rat races because they leave that petty sport to presidents, prime ministers, contesting parties and so forth, but whose turns of rudder from within their enterprises, even though for the slightest fraction of a degree, become decisive for the entire politics of Germany.
</p><p>The article was full of eye-candies, the main of which presented Herzog's closeup against the backdrop of his personal backyard park, some stunningly vast area, with blond-lock cupids of his grandkids playing toy bows between the trees.
</p><p>His forefathers, wandering Jew paddlers, hauled consumer goods from as far as China itself to trade with feudal dukes, and barons, and other kinds of the medieval bandits. Gentile barbarians paid the sidelocked Shylocks with all sorts of base abuse. And now he’s the upper dog, the monarch of a wealthy kingdom. Yet, is he happy?
</p><p>I doubted it strongly while considering the facial expression of Herr Herzog's smack-bang in the middle of that well-groomed park of his...
</p><p>OK, but, leaving royals alone, what about me? Am I happy here, lying on my side beneath the arboreal awning, enjoying whiffs of the soft breeze from the cool river, with all this helluva big lot of space for me and me alone?
</p><p>Some huge domain, indeed, this field overgrown with the knee-deep grass, and bluish spherical thorns looking like spiked maces, and that grand, Comelot<em>-toomb </em>over there, as tall as the residential towers bulking up along the highway between Kiev and the Borispol Airport. What else would you ask for to feel happy? Eh?
</p><p>A pretty interesting question if you come to think of it. Alas, no looking-glass in my haversack to knock out a self-diagnosis from the smart expression of my silly mug…
