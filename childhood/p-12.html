<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We lived on the second floor and our door was followed by that of the Morozovs, pensioner spouses in a three-room apartment. Opposite to them across the landing, there also was an apartment of three rooms, yet only two of them were dwelt by the Zimins family, while the third one was populated with single women, now and then replacing one another, at times there happened couples of women, who declared themselves relatives.
</p><p>The dead wall between the doors to the Morozovs’ and to the Zimins’ was divided with a vertical iron ladder reaching the open hatchway to the attic where the tenants hung their washing under the slate roof, and the father in the Savkins family—whose apartment was smack-bang opposite ours—kept pigeons after he came home and changed into his blue sportswear.
</p><p>The wooden handrail supported by the iron uprights ran from the Savkins’ door towards ours without crossing the whole landing though, because it turned down to follow the two flights of steps to the first-floor landing and from there four more steps down — to the staircase-entrance vestibule.
</p><p>The wide entrance door held closed by a big screechy iron spring, opened to the wide expanse of our block Courtyard, and the narrow door opposite it hid the steep steps into the impenetrable darkness of underground basement.
</p><p>Deducing from my subsequent life experience, I may safely assume that we lived in Flat 5 though at that time I didn’t know it yet. All I knew was that behind our door with a large homemade mailbox screwed up to it, there would open the hallway with the narrow door of the small storeroom to the left, and the glazed door of the parents’ room to the right, where instead of a window was the wide balcony door, also glazed in its upper part, facing the Courtyard.
</p><p>Straight ahead from the hallway started the long corridor to the kitchen, past two blind doors to the right, first that to the bathroom followed by the toilet door, while in the left wall immediately before the kitchen, there was just one, also blind, door to the children’s room that had two windows, one of which looked into the Courtyard and the other presented the view of murky windows in the plastered butt wall of the next, corner, house of the Block.
</p><p>The only window in the kitchen was looking at the same adjacent building, and the wall to the right from the kitchen door had  another quite small window frame, up under the ceiling, the matte glassed square of the toilet window, also filled with murky darkness unless the lamp there was on.
</p><p>Neither bathroom nor the storeroom squeezed behind its white door in the hallway had any windows at all, but in the ceiling of each of them, there hung an electric bulb – just click the black round switch jutting by the needed door, and step inside without angst…
</p><p>Entering the toilet, first of anything else I spat on the wall to the left from the throne and only then sat down to go potty and watch the slow progress of spittle leaving a  wet vertical trail on the green coat of paint. If the glob of the snailing saliva did not have sufficient reserves to reach the baseboard, I would assist it by an additional spit in the track – just above the stuck locomotive. At times the trip took from three to four spits and some other times the initial one was enough.
</p><p>The parents were perplexed with the spittle on the toilet wall until the day when Dad entered immediately after me, and at the strict interrogation that followed I admitted doing that, although I could not offer any explanation why.
</p><p>Since then, fearful of punishment, I blotted the traces of the wrong-doing with the pieces of cut-up newspapers from the cloth bag on the opposite wall but the thrill was gone.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…my son Ahshaut at the age of five sometimes peed past the john, on the toilet wall.
More than once I carefully explained him that it was not the right way of taking a leak, and those who missed the target should wipe up after themselves.
</p><p>One day he balked and refused to wipe the paddle. Then I grabbed at his ear, led him to the bathroom, and ordered to pick up the floor cloth, then led him back to the toilet where, in a rage-choked voice, ordered to collect all the urine from the floor with that cloth. He obeyed.
</p><p>Of course, in more civilized states I might get easily deprived of the parental rights for the child abuse of so violent a nature, still and all, I consider myself right at that particular development because no biological species can ever  survive in their own waste. I would savvy, were the kid just spitting on the wall, however, in the house that I built the toilet walls were simply whitewashed plaster and no spittle would crawl down such a surface.
</p><p>Later, the money for ceramic wall tiles got scraped up too, yet by that time the children were already adults…)
</p></div><p>You feel yourself kinda Almighty when reconstructing the world of a half-century ago, adjusting the details to your liking with no one to rub your nose in it even if you muck up.
</p><p>However, you can fool anyone but yourself, and I am ready to admit that now, from the distance in fifty years, not everything is falling in just nicely.
</p><p>For instance, I am far from certain that the pigeon enclosure in the attic had anything to do with Captain Savkin. The mentioned structure could as easily belong to Stepan Zimin, the father of Lyda and Yura...
Or maybe there were two enclosures?
</p><p>Frankly,  at the moment I am not sure about the presence of pigeons in one or the other enclosure (but were there two of them?) on the day when I ventured to climb up the iron ladder towards something unknown, indistinguishable in the murky square hole of the hatchway above my head. And it is pretty possible that I simply remembered the remark overheard in my parents’ chat, that Stepan’s pigeons also fell victim to his unrestrained booze binges.
</p><p>On the whole, just one thing stands beyond the shadow of a doubt – the tremulous ecstasy of revelation when, leaving behind my sister’s ominous predictions about the pending manslaughter of me by the fatherly hand, as well as silent stare of my brother who kept the close watch over each my movement from the ladder foot on the landing, diminishing as the height grew, I climbed into the brave new world unfurling before me beneath the grayish underbelly of the slate roof.
</p><p>A few days later Natasha came running into our room to proudly herald that Sasha had just climbed up to the attic too.
</p><p>Taking  into  account all of that, it is quite probable that the pigeons were gone from the attic enclosure, but in the Courtyard, there were hosts of them…
</p><p>The Courtyard’s layout presented an exquisite masterpiece of systematized geometricity itself.
</p><p>Inside the big rectangular outlined with six two-storied buildings, the ellipse of the road was inscribed and accentuated by knee-deep drenches along its both sides, crossed with albeit short, yet mighty bridges minutely opposite each of the fourteen entrances to the six houses constituting our block.
</p><p>Two narrow concrete walks aligned at right angles to the ellipse’s longitudinal axis cut it into three even chunks; the resultant rectangular in between the walks and the road ditches was further divided into three equal segments by the other couple of concrete paths parallel to the above-mentioned axis to connect the walks also mentioned already.
</p><p>The intersection points formed four corners of the central segment, from which the rays of four more concrete paths traversed the Courtyard diagonally directed towards the central entrances in the block’s corner buildings, the line between each pair of ray-starting points server the chord of a concrete path arc described about a round gazebo of wood, all in all, two of them, so that, on the whole, it presented the model of perfection reminiscent of the Versailles’ design, only of concrete.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…it is impossible to come across a so purified Bau Stile in nature. No circular circles exist among natural ones, neither absolutely isosceles triangles, nor flawless squares – someplace, somehow, the accomplished evenness would be inevitably ruined by the stubborn awl spiking through the Mother Nature’s haversack…)
</p></div><p>Of course, there were no fancy waterworks in our Courtyard, neither trees nor bushes. Maybe later they planted something there, yet in my memory, I can find not even a seedling, but only grass cut into geometric figures by the paths of concrete and loose pigeon flocks flying from one end of the vast Courtyard to the other when there sounded “…gooil-gooil-gooil-gooil-gooil-gooil-gooil!.” call.
</p><p>I liked these looking so alike, yet somehow different, birds flocking around you to bang the scattered bread crumbles away from the road on which you’d never see a vehicle except for a slow-go truck carrying, once in a blue moon, the furniture of tenants moving in or out, or a load of firewood for Titan boilers installed in the apartments’ bathrooms.
</p><p>But even more, I liked feeding pigeons on the tin ledge out the kitchen window. Although it took a long wait before some of the birds would get it where your “gooil-gooil” invitation was coming from and hover with the swish of air-cutting wings in the relentless flapping above the tin-clad ledge under the thick spill of breadcrumbs before landing on it with their raw legs to start the quick tap-tapping at the offer on the hollow-sounding tin.
</p><p>The pigeons seemed to have an eye on each other or, probably, they had some kind of intercom system because the first bird was very soon followed by others flying in, in twos and threes, and whole flocks, maybe even from the other block.
</p><p>The window ledge submerged into the multi-layer whirlpool of feathered backs and heads ducking to pick the crumbs, pushing each other, fluttering off the edge and squeezing in back again.
</p><p>Then, taking advantage of that pandemonium, you could cautiously put your hand out through the square leaf up in the kitchen window and touch from above one of their moving backs, but tenderly, so that they wouldn’t dash off with the loud flaps of the wings and rush away all at once…</p><br>
