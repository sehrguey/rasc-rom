 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Peace Square in front of the same-named movie theater was bounded with long five-story parallelepipeds of apartment blocks.
 The large fountain in its center, enclosed by the granite ring of a low parapet, was turned on no sooner than once in a couple of years to shoot up a high jet of water for an hour or two.
 The asphalt walks, lined with beautiful chestnut trees, led from the wide stone porch steps of the movie theater to the opposite square corners alongside the crosswise road of Peace Avenue.
 The lawns under the chestnuts had a couple of well-trodden short-cuts not provided by the original layout. Each of the shady alleys was equipped with a couple of benches of lengthy timber in the dark green coat of paint and two more of their breed stood openly  on the asphalt around the fountain.
</p><p>In the warm evenings, the square turned into the “whore-parade” grounds for dense waves of loungers walking leisurely the alleys, they didn't leave the square and just repeated their promenade circles, again and again, scanning the faces and clothes worn by the public in the counter-directed circulation, as well as by those seated on the benches.
</p><p>In their headway flowing motion, they shuffled through the soft dark layer, which got denser in front of the benches because  both the walkers and the sitters were engaged in  persistent ceaseless chewing of sunflower seeds and spitting the black inedible husk out…
</p><p>Sometimes after a movie show, I also went along with the lazy stream when making for the streetcar stop around the corner. It happened not too often though because from one sequel of “Fantômas” to another you had to wait for at least six months.
</p><p>In the daytime, the benches were mostly empty, though Kuba and I once happened to be called from a bench by a pair of young grown-up idlers who demanded kopecks.
 Kuba fired up trustworthy oaths that we had no money whatsoever, but I suggested to the louts, “Catch all that falls out!”
</p><p>With those words, I snatched the left pocket bag of my pants inside-out and expressively dusted it with my palm. I did not bother with the right pocket though, because it held ten kopecks for a streetcar fee.
</p><p>The slob in sunglasses looked around and threatened with a beating, yet he didn’t leave the bench. We took it for being dismissed and went on, while Kuba kept bitterly upbraiding me for such a stupid impudence which could quite easily end in a good scrub for my silly mug, and justly too.
</p><p>Probably, he was right, and I had missed to figure out such an outcome, carried away with the idea of making a fine gesture – to pull an empty pocket out.
</p><p>What saved me? The rogue might have decided that I was under the protection of some guy with a pull among the thieves, how, otherwise, to explain such reckless arrogance?.
</p><p>“Enters Sehrguey Ogoltsoff from Konotop!” announced Raissa, when I and Skully appeared in the Children Sector room. Marking that I couldn’t catch up with that particular piece of humor, she handed me <em>The Pioneer</em> magazine opened at a story, under which at the page bottom it stood in  black on white: “Sehrguey Ogoltsoff, the city of Konotop”.
</p><p>I had completely forgotten about those couple sheets from a school notebook depicting a chat with the dwarf who straddled a pen on my desk, sent half a year before to the contest of fantasy stories announced by the magazine.
</p><p>The talkative dwarf chattered of this and that making me more and more sleepy. And now, all of a sudden – wake up!
</p><p>The sweet whiff of fresh typography print emanating from the magazine pages set my head off in a slow swerve.  My legs kinda weakened, and I felt a soft blow at the back of my head, only somehow from inside.
Carefully, I lighted upon one in the tri-complected auditorium seats put along the ballet rail under the windows and read the publication where there hardly remained a paragraph from what I had sent to the contest.
</p><p>Yes, the dwarf still was there but talked nineteen to the dozen about a certain filmmaker Ptushko I had never heard of in my life.
 However, neither in Children Sector nor at home had I ever shared with anyone that the story comprised practically nothing by me except for the opening settings because not every day, after all,  they print your story in a thick monthly magazine…
</p><p>At the beginning of summer, Mother grew fat and Father, with a somewhat guilty chuckle, began to ask us—their children—what about having one more brother? The babe might be given a good name, like, Alyoshka, huh?
</p><p>Natasha wrinkled her nose, Sasha kept silent as well, and I said with a shrug, “What for?”
</p><p>The suggested increase in the family seemed unnecessary not as a threat of deterioration our living conditions, but because of the awkwardly crying difference in age between the would-be parents and the suggested baby.
 So Father effaced  his ingratiating smirk, dropped the subject and never picked it up again.
</p><p>A couple of weeks later, I accidentally heard how Mother gossiped with Aunt Lyuda, “I used the pill and the same day draft beer casks were brought to the stall, I rolled them in and – that’s it.”
</p><p>So, no quantity changes took place in our generation of the Konotop Ogotsoffs, yet Mother stayed looking fat forever…
</p><p>Her stall, a round hut under a tin roof, was advantageously located in the main alley of the Central Park of Recreation opposite Peace Square. The heavy padlock hung on the back door of sheet-iron, which she took off before a-trading through the front window with a square ledge-counter that jutted over the asphalted walk in the shade of mighty poplars.
</p><p>Beside the draft beer running from the faucet by the window, which she connected through a removable hose with one or another of the dark wooden casks, the goods at the stall included packs of cookies, cheap candies of a couple of sorts, cigarettes, lemonade and bottled wine – the Ukrainian fruit-and-berry “White Strong”, the dark red Georgian “Rkatsiteli”, and some wine of uncertain origin named “Riesling” which was so truly hard to sell out.
</p><p>“White Strong” was going out like hotcakes because of its price – one ruble and two kopecks a half-liter bottle. Cigarettes also did not stick around for long, yet the main engine to pull the trade was draft beer.
 When there was a delivery delay and they did not bring beer casks from the trade base of the Department for Workingmen Provision, aka ORS, Mother started to sigh and complain that the trade plan for her stall in the current month   seemed hardly doable and they again would cut her salary…
</p><p>My life rollicked on along its tracks which somehow bypassed the Central Park of Recreation, although my sister and brother occasionally boasted of dropping to Mother’s workplace for free lemonade.
 However, there happened one day which I spent at the stall from its beginning to end because of the secret service agent Alexander Belov, disguised as Johann Weiss…
</p><p>In those abysmally past times, to get subscribed   to <em>The Novel-Gazette</em>  was next to impossible.
 The monthly justified its name being turned out on inexpensive newsprint and in two columns per page, yet the thickness of an issue was on a par with  <em>The Pioneer</em> or <em>The Youth</em> magazines.
</p><p>Albeit absent from the subscription lists at the post-offices,<em> The Novel-Gazette</em> could still be found at libraries or borrowed from one or another luckier person who had asked it from the previous lucky beggar who, in their turn....
</p><p>If some novel happened to be too long for one issue, it was continued in the following month.
At times, deviating from the magazine name, they printed collections of stories or (quite rarely) poems, but no more than by a couple of authors per issue.
</p><p>Now, getting the word of mouth that in <em>The Novel-Gazette</em> they had recently published <em>The Shield and Sword</em> by Vadim Kozhevnikov, I rushed to the Club Library and was told that all the three consequential issues were already lent out, and they had to put together the queue-list of those wishing to borrow the masterpiece.
</p><p>No wonder, when Mother told that one of her colleagues gave her <em>The Shield and Sword</em> for a few days, the rails of my customary life tracks in one ‘tah-dah!’ made swing around and stretched to her stall, where I arrived the very next day soon after the opening hour…
</p><p>The initial issue I read in the stall, sitting on a wire box with empty bottles, before I got smart enough to move over onto a nearby bench, returning only to exchange the issues or sit in Mother’s place while she went to the park toilet when I even sold something.
</p><p>By the end of the day, I lived through the career of the Soviet intelligence officer Belov, aka Johann Weiss, from a private in the German Wehrmacht to an officer rank at the intelligence service of Abwehr.
</p><p>The trade during that day was rather sluggish, because the stall had run out of draft beer, and the empty casks piled up outside its back door.
</p><p>However, with the onset of twilight, when I moved back to the booth to finish off the final issue under a dim bulb hanging from the ceiling, at the very end of the Second World War, the flow of consumers began to increase.
</p><p>That’s it!. And, with the collapse of the Third Reich, I stacked all the three <em>The Novel-Gazettes</em> on a box by the door and saw that the trickle of customers had turned already into a line thickly crowding before the outside counter-ledger.
 There cropped thick growth of hands held up, kinda in the Nazi salutation, with crumpled rubles and handfuls of kopecks.
</p><p>Mother turned to me and said, “Wait a little, I’m closing in half-hour, we’ll go home together.”
</p><p>I sat leaning my back against the door, so as not to be in the way when she reached for goods from here and there in the narrow stall insides.
</p><p>The said half-hour later, the flurry by the stall in the park alley did not subside.
</p><p>“Maman! A pair of Strong Blondes and a small one of cookies!”
</p><p>“Auntie! Auntie! A pack of “Prima” cigarettes!”
</p><p>“Sister! A bottle of white!”
</p><p>“White is over.”
</p><p>“And over there? In that box?”
</p><p>“It’s Rkatsiteli for one ruble and thirty-seven.”
</p><p>“Alright, come on! Let it be it, we’re not racists!”
</p><p>Finally, the Georgian was over too, the crowd dissolved. Mother dropped the window shutter but had to open again for a latecomer trotting up along the dark alley. Grieved by the fact that everything was sold out, he bought a bottle of the uncertain expensive Riesling for a ruble seventy-eight, though it was already thirty minutes past the stipulated hours for alcohol selling.
</p><p>When Mother locked the stall and we walked to the streetcar stop at Peace Square, I asked if such mayhem was there every evening.
</p><p>“No, Sehryozha. It’s because it’s Sunday today.”</p>
