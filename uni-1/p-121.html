  <p>Just only four <em>dembels </em> still stuck around in the construction battalion – I, Gray, Red from Dnepropetrovsk, and Alexander Roodko.
  I had already got myself a parade-crap, borrowing it from a <em>pheasant</em> in Third Company. Because of transference after one year of service to Fourth Company as a stoker, I missed then getting a parade-crap both at First and Fourth Companies…
</p><p>Before the Morning Dispensing, there started up a round-dance by the <em>sorteer.</em>
  The eager on-lookers jogging to watch the entertainment  informed hastely, that the night before Gray made a <em>young </em>truck-crane driver take him from a site to the battalion and, when they reached Separate Company, he got to the wheel himself and crashed into a pole.
  Nothing terrible happened, the dented truck crane did not really need a repair. However, Chief of Staff, when they reported him on his arrival, went amok and wanted to kick Gray’s ass personally.
</p><p>"YOU FUCKER!"
  </p><p>What a mighty hook! The major put every kilo of his stout body into the ramming wallop and!. Whoops!. Gray dodged. Hmm...boo, Major!..and I had always thought you were a boxer...
  The soldiers helped Chief of Staff to get back on his feet. The on-duties convoyed beltless Gray to the clink…
</p><p>At the Morning Dispensing that followed, Zampolit announced that Red was going to the demobilization, and the next day Roodko and I as well. I approached him in the Staff half-barrack.
  </p><p>"Comrade Zampolit, I need a testimonial."
  </p><p>"What testimonial?"
  </p><p>"For admission to the institute."
  </p><p>"You are an absolute son of a bitch, Ogoltsoff!”, blurted Zampolit out, “ Are you fucking sane? An alky, junky, gangsta! I'll give you such a fucking testimonial that no Zona will accept you other than the jug for lifers! Fuck! It's our oversight that you get out of here at all. But you wait! The society will deal with you, they’ll crush you yet and grind down to the finest powder!"
  </p><p>Then three of us were paid money at the Staff's accountancy.
  Wow! So I even had some earnings! One hundred and twenty rubles for  two years of honest work…
  </p><p>Roodko and I went to see Red off and to equip ourselves at the same go.
  When in the city, Roodko bought a sports-bag for his journey home, and I chose a "diplomat" briefcase, they were just getting in vogue then.
  Its  inside between the gleaming plastic walls got piled with the dembel stuff: cellophane-wrapped pantyhose for Olga, a bottle of vodka for me and my father, and a crimson silk tablecloth with a fringe, for 7 rubles 50 kopecks, which Red had bought for his mother and asked me to keep in the "diplomat", while we were sprinkling down the dust on the way home that he started.
  Besides, I laded in the kicks  bought by me – light and practical footwear with black corduroy tops for just six-fifty, because in the battalion I couldn't find high shoes for the borrowed parade-crap, and was shopping in a pair lent me by the Third Company on-duty sergeant for just a day.
</p><p>  After the Red's way was sprinkled properly and our clamorous goodbyes were nearing the bus stop for Red to go to the railway station, I was not drunk and clearly remembered that crimson silk tablecloth inside my "diplomat".
  I did not remind Red of the gift he had bought for his mother. I stole it.
</p><p>At some point, giving me one last chance, he turned a sobered up look at me to check if I would  tell him. But I kept silent. He dropped his head drunkenly and walked on to board the bus.
  I watched the distance growing between us on the sunlit sidewalk – ten meters, twenty… But I never called out, "Hey, Red! You forgot it, buddy!"
</p><div id="span"><p>(....and no prissy bitch on the Varanda river banks could ever bring about redemption for this my dirt...)
</p></div><p>Next morning, Roodko and I stood facing the ranks of VSO-11 and Chief of Staff announced that we were going to the demobilization.
  We both made the  "to left!" turn – I, with my black "diplomat", and Roodko, with his blue sports bag and marched forth.
</p><p>After a couple of steps we did, Battalion Commander spotted the corduroy kicks on me heading to the gate behind which the society lurked in ambush making ready to grind me down to powder at the nearest convenient moment.
  Battalion Commander made the last, desperate, attempt at saving the doomed, "What the fuck?! See the fucking shit on the son of a bitch!"
  However, Chief of Staff cut short his solicitously protective impulse, "Let the fucker get the fuck out!” said he, "The motherfucker has fully motherfucked already all and  fucking every one here!"
  </p><p>Good-bye and you, Fathers-Commanders…
    </p><p>But even 24 hours later I was still in Stavropol, at the city airport of plainly rustic looks.
  Just having served "two winters and two summers" was not enough, you still had to reach home.
</p><p>I had a flight ticket to Kiev bought from the city Aeroflot office, but when I arrived at the kolkhoz field of an airport, the flight was delayed for an hour, then for another hour and only by noon the piston-plane AN-24 ran along the takeoff strip, and beneath the wing of the aircraft, through the muffled hum of motors, floated rarefied clouds over topographic landscapes.
  The construction battalion stayed in the past, but it still hanged about and I was thinking of the First Company master sergeant who stuck to me on a city bus last week.
  </p><p>And it was so stupid, did he really need it when clad in his civilian outfit? Because he was drunk, he wanted to show off what an important piece of shit he was, that's why.
  </p><p>"What are you doing here? Back to barracks! I'll report to Battalion Commander at the Morning Dispensing!"
  </p><p>"And I'll say you were drunk as a swine."
  </p><p>No one said anything to anyone…
  </p><p>And that major also was in his civilian, so how could I know?
  </p><p>"I'm a Major!"  shrieked he, "How dare you?"
  </p><p>Who'd guess you were a Major when you have civilian rags on?
  Look at me – all's in full view; the black shoulder loop clear of any yellow crap means clear conscience – a rank-and-file construction battalion!
  </p><p>It's because of that barmaid in the café that we came to grips.
  She was a juice sort and, at first, it was me who she addressed the purposeful swing of her ample breasts to, before he flashed his rank trump, or was he bluffing?
  Nah, you can't dupe such a woman…
</p><p>I still belong to the Construction Battalion, forever.
  Some part of it stays in me, until the end.
</p><p>But I did not think of anything like that then, I was just a <em>dembel</em> flying home. Not home meaning "barracks", but home meaning "home".
  Although my mother wrote in her letter that they had sold their quarter-<em>khutta</em> in Nezhin Street, and bought half-<em>khutta</em> someplace deeper in the Settlement.
  No fear, I got the address, I would find it.
  </p><p>But I couldn't think about Konotop for long, I got accustomed to thinking about other things and so I thought my usual thoughts…
  As we took the drummer from Pyatigorsk to the military flight school to show that he was really good.
</p><p>There went three of us – Long, the drummer and I. We wanted the cadets from the vocal-instrumental ensemble at the flight school saw for themselves that the drummer was a pro so that they would put a word to their zampolit to find him some position in their school <em>chmo </em>because he had to be drafted to the army. Such was the idea.
  </p><p>The cadets were, so too conveniently, rehearsing on the stage in the hall like a summer cinema, without the roof. They handed Long their guitar, the drummer sat behind the drums...
  Wow! The two dudes made a duet da bomb, a potpourri from Jimmy and Jimmy, they unleashed  their souls in full letting them on a free flight...
  Poor fools! They sort of run a bulldozer over those rosy cadets in their blue shoulder loops who needed a drummer of the kind that follows the pioneer banner next to the bugler with the red pennant on his horn:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">du-du-du-dú! du-du-du-dú!
</p><p>Not a chance they'd ever mention   such a Drummer to their zampolit.
  So well-groomed boys, them those cadets; well-fed too...
  </p><p>Was it all over? No more evening roll-calls? Neither Zampolit, nor Chief of Staff, nor pieces…
  I was flying home; at home, everything would be <em>nyshtyak!</em> Not for nothing, I had been dreaming of it all those two years, or rather did not allow myself to ever think about home…
</p><p>That was my first flight on an airplane; better than crawling for the whole two days by train.
  My wrist still hurt a bit; that fool of a bitch in the hotel the night before.
  She would give, only there was nowhere; let's go to your room, said she.
  I asked the mujiks in the room, and they left.
  </p><p>So, while she was demonstrating her unbreakable virginity and maiming my wrist with her fingernails, they started to come back, one by one. The séance is over.
  But I didn't strong-arm her, she just grabbed my hand and started her claw-work.
  That Stavropol was just some breeding ground for sadist chicks, I swear.
  </p><p>Hopefully, Olga would not notice... but if she would, then what? You could get any kind of scars when on your combat duty…</p>
