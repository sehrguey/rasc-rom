<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Parade of Planets<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>Yes, shortly before that talk, on a clear peaceful autumn day, I went out for a walk wearing my shoes. They were not torn, of course, but fairly worn-out along the sidewalks of Odessa and country roads in the adjacent Komintern district.
The walk inspired an elegiac mood. I recollected the distant galaxies on the smooth sea under the steep cliffs near Vapnyarka, the endlessly long street of Kotovsky's Road, and the ridiculously short one of Sholem Aleichem, that were walked along in those brown leather shoes with lengthwise incut pieces in their toe caps' tops. They were sort of a spaceship on the return from an interstellar expedition across the universe – still alive, but hopelessly out of vogue...
</p><p>When I was kicking them off in the hallway, Gaina Mikhailovna remarked that it was time to use some warmer footwear. I felt really pleased with such caring attentiveness from my mother-in-law...
</p><p>And I could not deny the delayed quality of my reaction to any questioning.
Each inquiry that I was addressed with fired up an inaudibly rumbling computer in my mind (although I did not even know  the word "computer" then) revving in a hectic round of the combinatorial analyses of all the possible responses to choose the one whose value would not lose its validity even in the most unforeseeable future.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...an idiot!
All that, in fact, was needed:
</p><p>"A?. Yes,.. Hmm..."...)
</p></div><p>As for the entrenched defense line around your carriage, I have already mentioned it.
</p><p>Nonetheless, even fully aware of my innocence, I never thought of debating or proving anything—especially since I had no excuse for neither the warm rain nor the annihilation of cannabis in merciless conflagration—so I just went where Eera led me...
</p><p>It was a corridor on the second floor in an unfamiliar building with wide floorboards painted red.
The place was rather crowded.
On the whitewashed wall, there hung a sheet of Whatman paper with a picture executed with crayons in the technique of <em>The Merry Pictures</em> magazine where a kettle addressed a washcloth with the question, "Why did you tell the saucer I was a colander?"; most likely, a gift from some art lover patronizing the institution.
A young man in the army officer pea-jacket without any insignia was happily contemplating the picture. His forage cap was tilted a sliver of a notch on a screwballish side.
</p><p>Eera entered one of the offices to state complaints.
Then they called me in, but no conversation followed. The doctor, addressing exclusively Eera, announced  that I should be examined in Chernigov because he was not qualified for the like cases, not even competent.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...exactly as my father used to say:
"They are sitting there, getting their salary but when you turn to them – 'I am not Copenhagen!' is all they  ever can give out!"...)
</p></div><p>The Chernigov psychiatric hospital was located four kilometers from the city, in full correspondence to the nearby bus stop named "The 4th kilometer".
The gate in the tall concrete wall of the institution was conveniently nearby the bus stop. Behind the wall, there was a large complex of buildings in the modern huge-block architectural style which could readily beautify the city center, were it no so far off.
</p><p>We walked alongside the cluster of red-tiled buildings of various height; some of them were bridged with indoor galleries or connected with lower structures.
Eera was obviously oppressed by that severe Bau Stile void of fanciful conceits, quite understandably though, not everyone appreciates that particular variety of architecture and I, personally, would sooner pull for works by Corbusier too.
</p><p>I escorted silent Eera, looking glum and sullen at the moment, to the required building where we were accepted in a small one-window office by a dark-haired woman in a white robe named Tamara...er...Tamara...well, I am sorry, her patronymic escaped my mind.
At the desk by the window, there sat a man of a well-trained carcass, also in white.
</p><p>
Tamara gently invited us to get seated on the soft sofa in a white cloth case by the wall and retired to the armchair by the opposite one. There followed a conversation of nothing in particular, but when she asked me
  about my preferences in music, the man by the window started to prompt, "Variety, of course!", which convinced me that his presence was not for just to ensure Tamara's security, if I were a violently deviated case.
So I had to honestly admit having more than one preference: Ella Fitzgerald and Johann Sebastian Bach, because I do not drive a fool about the things that really matter.
</p><p>Tamara told Eera that deviations of my kind were not of dangerous nature, however, if so was Eera's wish and if I did not mind, they could keep me for more close observation.
</p><p>I did not mind, only warned that on Saturday it was my brother's wedding to which Eera and I had been invited and, if Tamara considered it acceptable, I would come back to the 4th kilometer on Monday. Upon my word of honor.
</p><p>Tamara  most kindly concurred and saw us out into the corridor. From behind the glazed door in its end, there came a muffled noise of a multitudinous assemblage…
</p><p>By that time my brother Sasha had already moved from PMS to KhAZ and was working on some sophisticated milling-grinding machine...
The KhAZ was not the KhAZ itself, but only a branch of the Kharkov Aviation Plant. They did not assemble any planes at the branch, but produced spare parts of most different configurations, packed them in boxes, and sent to KhAZ or to its other branches in some other cities.
In Konotop, the KhAZ branch was named, for shortness, just KhAZ and everyone was eager to get a job there because of high wages. Sasha earned 200 rubles a month!
The rest of the workers got a lower payment because there was just one machine tool of so superb high-precision.
</p><p>Another advantage of KhAZ was its location in the Settlement, you could come home for the midday break and have your <em>havvage.</em>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there was a drawback too, KhAZ made you work longer than just eight hours a day.
No, there were no labor legislation violations. Sasha was leaving his workplace at five sharp, but his work overtook him when already at home.
 He complained to me that even watching football on TV, he contemplated his working plans for the following day: which spare parts to work on in the morning, and which after the midday break.
I felt sorry for my brother, but didn't know how to help him out…
</p><p>In the Settlement, earning 200 rubles a month, you could start up a family of your own without hesitation.
</p><p>Sasha's chosen one, Lyuda, worked at "The Optics" store in Zelenchuk Area and she also was from the Settlement.
Besides, she was a really enviable bride having two <em>khuttas</em> or, rather, each of her estranged, though not divorced, parents had a separate one, which guaranteed the young family immediate solution to the problem of housing, one way or the other.
Who would decline to live in clover? Thus, my brother became an Adoptee.
</p><p>Eera was going to buy bed linen as the wedding present, but all the traces of such goods had long disappeared from the stores.
The explanation of the fact provided by the planned economy we lived under  deducted that particular shortage from the World Olympics which Moscow was to host the following year, and the mentioned commodity would be needed for doing beds in the Olympic Village.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...in a flash-forward, I can assure that two years later bedding remained a sharp deficit.
I just cannot imagine what those guest sportspersons were doing with it in the Olympic Village...)
</p></div><p>So, for the wedding present Eera bought a nice jug of red transparent glass, wisely reasoning that the bedsheets would wear out very quickly but the jug—if not broken—could stand in the hutch until the golden anniversary...</p>
