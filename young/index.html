 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Youth<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>After that summer many of my classmates were not around anymore, they moved or went to different technical and vocational schools.
 Kuba entered the Odessa Sea School, Volodya Sherudillo became a student at the Konotop Vocational School 4, aka GPTU-4, which institution among Konotopers bore the unofficial name of "Seminary" turning its disciples into "the seminarists".
 Skully endeavored to enter some Mining School in Donetsk but eventually landed in the Konotop Railway Transportation College.
</p><p>The class parallel to ours at School 13 also lost about half of its students, and the remnants of 8 ”A” and 8 “B” were put together into the single ninth grade…
 </p><p>On the first school day, after the ceremonial line-up concluded with the traditionally endless bell signaling the start of the first lesson in the academic year, our classroom was entered by Valera Parasyouk, handled Quak.
  He was a blonde tenth-grader running after some girl from the former parallel and popped up on the pretext of a casual visit just, like,  to hello the guys.
</p><p>The Ukranian Language teacher, Fedosya Yakovlevna, handled Feska, with the straight parting in her colorless hair braided into a pitiful crown, came the second having ceded Quak about half-minute. Yet, full of sporting spirit, she indicated the door and ordered him to leave the classroom. Without much a-do Quak satisfied her demand, yet chose another, his own, way; he climbed onto the windowsill and departed by jumping off into the schoolyard. His black, well-polished, shoes flashed on the flight, kinda a bright goodbye .
</p><p>Not for nothing the Chemistry teacher, Tatyana Fyodorovna, handled Hexabenzyl, was in the habit of bringing those his shoes to our attention, "If a guy's shoes shine, that means he's looking after himself. Follow the example of Parasyouk whose shoes are always polished!"
</p><p>So, Fedosya Yakovlevna, aka Feska, closed the window left open by Valera Parasyouk, aka Quak, and called the class to pay no attention to his antics because he didn't belong here any more but transferred already to School 14 (which was the other of two schools in the Settlement) as long as he dwelt next to the mentioned school location and from now on he was the resident headache of teachers over there...
</p><p>The best way to learn the worth of new acquaintances and getting rubbed along with each other is doing some mutual job...
 After a week of classes, the senior grades at our school were instructed to report present in the schoolyard on Sunday morning equipped with buckets because we were going to help the kolkhoz in the Podlipnoye village with harvesting their crop.
</p><p>The day was glorious – a warm September day enjoying the bright sun in the blue sky. The clamorous column of students reached the edge of a cornfield and we were tutored on the technique of harvesting at hand.
</p><p>Pull the ear off the stem, shuck and drop it in your bucket. When the bucket’s filled up, take it to the common cob of ears and pour your share into it.
The entirety of so simple actions becomes the process of "patronage assistance to a collective farm". </p><p>Each patronizer was put before a row of corn stalks to go along and harvest the ears on their way to the other end of the field.
  And off we went in one united push, mingling the ear dubs at tin buckets' buttoms with cheerful juvenile yells, and the wise admonitions of caring teachers, and tangent yet loud bangs of thunderflashes thrown high in the cloudless sky…
</p><p>It did not take long before I noticed my lagging behind the general progress. So, hauling another filled bucket to the cob, I paid attention that not all the cornrows were clear of all the corn ears in them. It seemed, the instructors failed to be explicit enough and emphasize that our objective was not  collecting all ears in the field, but to select best of the best, the most gorgeous cream of ears, so to say.
</p><p>Correcting my working practices accordingly, in no time I caught up with the main body of the patronizers, then got ahead, and overtook the avant-garde party which now grew to four advanced shock-workers.
</p><p>Being ahead of the common mass of laborers had a number of advantages. First and foremost, you didn't need to go back to the common cobs of the harvested corn ears. As soon as your bucket got filled, you just poured the ears on the ground, becoming the founder of a new cob for pending contribution of those coming later.
</p><p>A couple of guys from the avant-garde party chose the path of least resistance, throwing the ears from their rows in all directions, so as not to bother with shucking them. I did not follow their best practices though because the field edge could already be seen in the distance.
</p><p>We went out to a fallow field, and for another half-an-hour lay prostrate in the grass, more fatigued by waiting for the general mass to join us than by our super-productive efforts…
</p><p>In September, the Arkhipenkos moved to Ryaboshapka Street near the RepBase who allotted to a turner of theirs, Uncle Tolik, together with his family an apartment in a five-story block. The mode of life in our <em>khatta</em> turned more convenient because our parents went over to sleep in the kitchen…
</p><p>Soon after, there appeared a new tenant in the <em>khutta</em> – Grigory Pilluta who had served his ten years for murder, and came back to his home sweet home.
 </p><p>The slick forelock of dark hair screened his forehead and shaded the eyes in their steady stare down or aside.  Silent and sullen, passed he the <em> khutta </em> yard from the wicket to his porch way.
 </p><p>His return from jail did not put end to the Pillutikha's concerts through the wall. Although one day, passing under their kitchen window, I heard his rude attempt at shutting up her stream of execrations pored against the whitewashed kitchen wall…
 </p><p>In the dead of night, I was wakened by Father looming above me in the scarce light of the desk lamp. Mother stood in the doorway from the kitchen, and Sasha and Natasha looked  sleepily out from under their blankets.
 </p><p>Father told me that Pilluta was breaking our entrance door armed with a knife, and I had to climb down out of the room window and bring two axes from the workshop in the lean-to. There was no time for dressing up – through the drown in  blackness kitchen there came sounds of heavy blows at the door on the porch, and thick drunken cries addressed to Mother, "Open it, bitch! I'll get your guts out!"
 </p><p>I quickly brought the required tools and together with Father went to guard the door quaking under the blows accompanied by the animal bawls of Grigory Pilluta. How long would the rim lock last?
 </p><p>We stood at the ready in our underpants and tank-shirts holding the axes in our hands. "Seryozha," said Father in a keyed-up voice, "when he breaks in do not hit with the blade, use the butt!" I felt scared, yet at the same time wanted Pilluta to break in sooner at last.
 </p><p>He never did it. In the dark yard sounded Pillutikha's wails and assuaging male voice. It was Yura Plaksin, Grigory Pilluta's childhood chum from the<em> khutta</em> in Gogol Street, opposite the water pump. He took the drunk away with him...
 We left the axes by the door and went to sleep on.
</p><p>In the morning, I observed the deep scratches left by knife stabs in the gray paint coating of the entrance door. The good news it did not happen in winter, with the additional window frames inserted for warmth, those had no hinges and just sealed the whole of the window from inside, so how would I get out to the lean-to?
 </p><p>Then Yura Plaksin came on a visit pleading not to inform the precinct militiaman about the incident...
 </p><p>One of the axes stayed in the veranda for a long time, until Grigory Pilluta moved somewhere in the city from his mother's<em> khutta</em> to keep clear from the harm. Stupid indeed of his mother to wind him up, and then run after Yura Plaksin’s assistance, to save the obedient sonny from getting locked up again.
 </p><p>Maybe, Grigory’s departure had other reasons as well, how could I know? Another guy's life is a dark abyss for those outside.
  Later, I sometimes met him in the city but never more in the yard of our <em>khutta…</em>
</p><p>With the Pillutikha's death, the population in the whole <em>khutta</em> grew drastically because Grigory sold his parental home to some newcomers from Siberia.
 </p><p>That fact did not mean at all that they were Siberians themselves. You could go there from any Republic, just get recruited for work and – full ahead.
 </p><p>The so-called "chasing the long ruble" was mainly steered in that direction because salaries in the uninhabited Taiga places were much higher. Folks were coming back with their suitcases packed with money to the gills, so were the rumors. If they could manage it, of course, I mean to return at all. The popular byword made it clear that "the longer the ruble, the shorter the life".
 </p><p>One guy from the Settlement recruited to a mine beyond the Urals and in just six months they sent him back.
  There, in that mine, he was in charge of the machinery and equipment repair. Something stopped working, they switched the faulty contraption off and he crawled in to see what's up.
 At that moment the switch was turned on (they had forgotten he was inside or something) and the mechanism chopped him so finely that he arrived to his parents <em>khutta</em> inside a zinc coffin in the form of minced meat.
</p><p>In the Ballet Studio of Nina Aleksandrovna, he was a leading dancer, such a tall brunette. When performing the Moldovan Jock he jumped higher than others with his legs wide apart in the air to slap the ballet boots with his hands. And the Moldovan waistcoat of black silk with sparkling sequins  suited so well his crispy dancing hair…</p>
