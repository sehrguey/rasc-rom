<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Birchbark Sketches<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This empyrean grabbed my attention six years ago when the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Mountainous Karabakh, newly independent and never recognized by the indifferent external world, here arranged sort of a Pioneer tent camp  for school kids of Stepanakert.
</p><p>Sahtic worked there through all the camp sessions, back-to-back. My humbly tentative suggestion to leave our dearest offsprings to my fatherly care and custody was turned down with a sarcastic scoff. That’s why Ahshaut and Emma had to while away the whole summer by their mother’s side, all the three sessions, back-to-back, in the camp platoons befitting their respective age and gender.
</p><p>The eldest child in our family, Ruzanna, having just passed her university exams for the second year of study, joined them there and picked up the job of self-styled unsalaried Pioneer Leader, because she always knew what she wanted and never could be stopped by anything short of the force major...
</p><p>After a couple of weeks staying home alone, I got bored stiff by the goddamned mum evenings about our house, and one late afternoon I left the city in the direction of the Sarushen village. On the way, I bought a pack of cookies and some candies from a petty shop in the town outskirts. (By that time in my life I grew wise enough to  realize that the joy of seeing Daddy needs a proper reinforcement, the sweeter the better.)
 Hitchhiking, I reached the village and at dark got to the camp.
</p><p>Just about the same spot where I am lying now, there stood the folding canvas stool of Camp Director, Shahvarsh, on which no one ever dared get seated except him, kinda local species of the frigging Coronation Boulder in Scotland.
And on the broad trunk of this walnut tree, even then lightning-split already, there hung a single bright lamp, fed by softly whirring power generator, spilling its light into the black nearby darkness to outline two long tables of sheet-iron along the field edge, each one accompanied with a couple of long, narrow, equally chilling benches of the same material.
</p><p>Much blacker silhouettes of two squat pyramids of army tarpaulin tents bulked in the dark field: one for all the girls at the camp, the other for the boys and Gym Teacher. A little to the left there stood a six-person tent of Caretakers.
The formation was concluded by a two-person tent for Camp Director Shavarsh and his wife, who also embraced the positions of Cook and Paramedic.
</p><p>Deeper in the field, some thirty meters to the right from the tents, a tame campfire was licking  with lazy quiet tongues of flame the end of a sizable log, a tree-trunk, actually, with its boughs chopped off and propelled, as needed, into the gleaming embers of the burned down wood…
</p><p>All of Camp Caretakers were, naturally, teachers from the city schools, for whom the solitary lamp light was enough to identify me and call  Sahtic. Ruzanna came running after. They both were glad to see me, though with a trace of inward strain in Sahtic, prepared to knock off any funny stuff of mine if not in line with the local customs shaped and ground by quite a few millennia of use.
</p><p>As it befell, I was not in the mood to fool about any fundamental matters and just behaved, sat down at the table with the camp dinner in progress, and appreciatively accepted a plate of oatmeal, a spoon, and a slice of bread. I even ventured to bite a little bit off that bread, but it proved to be no match for plastic teeth which fact make me  inconspicuously put the rock-hard slice aside and concentrate exclusively on the porridge.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…How come that make-believe pioneer camp, a keepsake from the happy Soviet times, popped up in the country whose Minister of Education confessed, in a fit of openness, that his ministry cannot even buy a football for School 8?
</p><p>Supposedly, the Diaspora provided a target grant and end summer the oversea philanthropists would be treated to a nice report brimming with genuinely grateful glee: “Thanks to the $40,000 of your generous donation, all the schoolchildren from the City of Stepanakert, the capital of the Republic of Mountainous Karabakh, were presented with the unique opportunity to enjoy…”)
</p></div><p>The commenced composition of the report to hypothetical donors from presumed grant-rippers was interrupted by the happy squeals of Emma snuggling to my side.
</p><p>I fondly stroke her straight hair and the narrow back of a preschool child, asked some casual questions; she was answering and asking me back. “And where’s Ahshaut? D’you know?”
</p><p>She pointed at the far end of the next table where the light from the lamp dissolved in the surrounding night. Ahshaut sat there, forgetful of the meal, a-gape in admiration for the high school teenagers who towered about him in raucous cackling of their nonstop rookery...
 I took the package out from the pocket of my summer jacket and gave it to Emma asking to share the sweets with her brother. She quietly walked away…
</p><p>Then there was a dinner for adults. Camp Caretakers, all of them females recruited from among the city school teachers, modestly drank wine. Gym Teacher, Camp Director, the precinct policeman from a nearby village, and I was sharing traditional <em>tutovka</em>.
</p><p>For a snack, we had some small fry, banged in the river with an electric discharge from the power generator which was borrowed from the camp by the precinct policeman earlier in the day. The electrocuted catch was then fried by Cook, aka Paramedic, aka Camp Director’s wife...
</p><p>A group of teenagers approached the table with a petition to Shavarsh to allow some dancing to which he graciously decreed a half-hour delay in the camp lights-out.
</p><p>Meanwhile, I asked Ruzanna about Ahshaut. She answered that he was already sleeping in the boys' tent and volunteered to fetch him, but I said, “No, don’t disturb.”
</p><p>The teenagers gathered by the campfire and danced to the music from the loudspeaker box hanging from the tree next to the walnut with the lamp.
 At first, it seemed strange that each of them danced with their backs to the feast of seniors at the sheet-iron table, but then I cracked it: everyone danced with their personal shadow cast off by the lamplight into the night field.
Then Camp Director announced it was enough, switched the generator off, and retired to his royal double tent...
</p><p>Some of the camping teenagers sneaked, in twos and threes, to the quietly glowing log to scare each other with spooky stories, as old as the hills, and to laugh at the timeless jokes up to one or two past midnight, under the sympathetic supervision by Caretakers, their school teachers, taking turns in the night shift.
</p><p>I stayed there till one o’clock and then accepted the suggestion to go and sleep on a vacant camp-cot in the boys’ tent, leaving Sahtic to do her turn by the fire, because I had to walk away at six in the morning so as to catch the bus to Stepanakert…
</p><p>Years later, I asked Ahshaut why he did not come up to me that night. He answered that he was told about my visit only the following day when I had already left the camp. To my question about the biscuits and candies, he only responded with an uninformed shrug.
</p><p>I don’t blame Emma. At the age of six, to finish on the sly a pack of biscuits that turned up along with that camp rations is just a normal manifestation of healthy selfishness.
</p><p>Yet poor Ahshaut! How does it feel to grow up knowing (even though that knowledge since long has been buried away and securely forgotten, it still remains there) that your father did not want to come up to you? From all of the family, it’s only you that your father did not want to come up to…
</p><p>Well, let bygones be bygones or, quoting the regular adage from my latest mother-in-law, Emma Arshakovna: “So’s life, see?.”
</p><p>Eeewwwww!. Who let them icky blues sneak into this luxuriously spacey place for me alone?. To hell all them nostalgic crappy sentiments! Let’s have a little knock-up with the legitimate venville  hooliganism…
</p><p>Bypassing thickets on the steep slope, I explore the underwood along the field edge, pulling a broken bough here, a dead sapling there onto the desolate cow path. After advancing in that manner some two hundred meters, I turn about and go back picking up the firewood scattered over the path. With an ample armful of fuel, I come back to the former campsite, then re-track to fetch another bundle; and one more. That’s that.
</p><p>The next step is breaking brushwood for the fire to process “pioneers’ fav’rite food-ood-ood”, as a cheerful Soviet song christened baked potatoes. And that piece of work I had to do with bare hands being equipped not even with  a knife.
</p><p>At times the fact of my hiking unarmed astounds people, and they commence to give out horror stories of hungry wolves or cruel robbers. As it stands, in all my annual escapes to the wilderness, I’ve only seen deer and foxes, and a couple of times bear steps, but no robbers ever bothered to ambush me in the<em> toombs</em>.
</p><p>Yet, once I got attacked indeed, when spending the night under a bush nearby the Mekdishen village in my sleeping bag additionally wrapped over with a piece of blue synthetic burlap. (The shoddy crap drenches through in the rain before you say “knife”, but that was before I got this Made-in-China tent.)
</p><p>It was about midnight, when two wolfhounds, escorting a belated horseman, ran into me stretched on the ground. Damn! What a hell of barking broke loose over my head!
</p><p>Their master arrived at the scene with his flashlight and was stunned with so strange a sight in his native quarters, but the blue sack yelled from under the bush that it was a tourist from Stepanakert and let him call back his bloody beasts.
</p><p>The mujik started the all too familiar blah-blah about the wolves, for which I was not in the mood and cut him short that after his gumprs nothing would ever scare me anymore…
</p><p>And at the sleepover upon the Dizzuppaht, which is the third highest mountain in Karabakh, half an hour after me there climbed up a party of guys from the Halo Trust. That is an international organization headquartered in Great Britain, who finance and teach techniques of mine clearance to the natives of hot spots at war all over the globe because conflicting sides have a nasty custom of setting up lots of minefields to kill as many people from the opposite side as possible.
</p><p>Now, the local sappers (instructed by native Britons) climbed the Dizzuppaht on their off-duty time to perform a  <em>pleading mahtagh</em>, because atop that mountain, from time immemorial, there stood a stone chapel which you should walk around, thrice, for your request to be approved by the authorities of fate.
</p><p>The Halo Trust guys, naturally, did not come empty-handed, they brought a rooster with them for the sacrificial offering. But because of the somewhat impromptu nature of their  <em>mahtagh</em>-doing, they missed to bring a knife along and were expressly disappointed to learn that neither had I...
 Yet, the inventive folks found a novel technique on-the-fly and chopped the bird’s head off with the piece of a broken bottle collected from the heap of garbage left by all the previous  <em>mahtagh</em>-doers…
</p><p>It’s only that year when I climbed the second highest peak in the region, the Keers, I had an imitation of a Swiss army knife, a present from Nick Wagner. It had a whole bunch of things in its handle: a fork, a corkscrew, and even a nail file. I can’t remember where I misplaced it afterward.
</p><p>But, however long were I bragging and showing off, the region’s peak number one remains absent from the peacock tail of my vagrant achievements. The front line of the unfinished war between Armenians and Azerbaijanis runs across that mountain. So, if not one side, then the other wouldn’t let me pass up, or they’d just bang from both sides synchronously.<br>
