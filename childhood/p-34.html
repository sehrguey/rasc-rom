<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>
End April, we became young pioneers. The ceremony took place not at school but in front of the House of Officers because there stood the big gypsum head of Lenin upon the tall pedestal.
</p><p>The night before, Mom ironed my trousers through gauze and also the white parade-shirt and the scarlet silk triangle of pioneer tie. All those things she hung over the back of a chair so that in the morning everything would be ready.
</p><p>When there was no one in the room, I touched the soft caressing fabric of the pioneer tie. Mom said she had bought it from the store, but it’s impossible for such things to be for sale.
</p><p>The bright morning sun was shining. We, the fourth-graders, stood facing the lined-up ranks of the school children. Our scarlet ties hung on our right arms bent at the elbow, the collars of our shirts were turned up for the senior graders to easily tie our ties around.
</p><p>Yet before that moment, we canted the memorized Solemn Oath in front of our comrades to love our Homeland hotly, to live and learn and struggle as admonished by great Lenin, as we were always being taught by the Communist Party…
</p><p>One week before the end of the academic year I fell ill.
 Mom thought it was a cold and told me to stay in bed but could not bring the temperature down, and when it rose up to forty she called an ambulance from the Detachment’s Hospital because with two more degrees the temperature would become lethal.
</p><p>I was too lightheaded to be proud or frightened that a whole vehicle came after just me alone. At the hospital, they at once diagnosed pneumonia and began to knock the temperature down with penicillin injections every half-hour. I did not care.
<br>A day later the injection frequency was reduced to one per hour, the following day – one in two hours…
</p><p>The patients in the ward were all adults, soldiers from the Regiment.
In four days, I was quite okay and walking in the garden around the Hospital, when our class together with the teacher came to visit me and hand over the report card with my grades.
</p><p>I felt uncomfortable and, for some reason, ashamed, so I ran away around the corner followed by the boys of our class. But then we returned, and the girls together with the teacher presented me with the award for successful studies and exemplary behavior. It was the book of <em>The Russian Epic Tales </em>which Grandma Martha read to me, and my sister-and-brother, but only quite a new one...
That way, little by little, things began somehow repeat themselves in my life…
</p><p>In summer we were again taken to the pioneer camp to the same canteen, lining-ups, bedroom ward, “stiff hours”, and Parental Days.
</p><p>Though certain things had notably changed because as a full-fledged pioneer, I already belonged to the Third Platoon which, together with the First and Second ones, was eligible for swimming in the lake. But first, we had to wait a week in anxious hope that it shouldn’t rain on the appointed day.
</p><p>We waited eagerly, and on the swimming day the weather was not rainy, so two trucks with canvas tops took us to the Sominsky lake.
</p><p>The road went through the forest, along some narrow endless clearing. And  the ride was also very long because we had sung all the pioneer songs, both my favorite “ah, potato’s so tasty-tasty-tasty-tasty…”, and the one I liked less, but still for pioneers – “we marched to the ding of the cannonade…”, and, well, all that we knew, anyway, but the road did not end and I felt sick with all those jolts on the bumps in the road.
  </p><p>Then those, who sat at the square window cut in the front canvas wall, shouted that something was seen ahead and the truck pulled up on a grassy shore of a big lake amid the forest.
</p><p>They allowed us to enter the water not all at once but in turn, one platoon after another.
 The water was very dark, and the bottom felt unpleasantly quaggy, and they too soon yelled from the shore, “Third platoon – out!”
</p><p>At first, I only stood up to the chest in the water doing shallow hops. But then they gave me an air-filled life ring of rubber and showed how to row with my hands and kick my legs for swimming.
</p><p>Soon both the caretakers and the pioneer leaders grew bored to command the platoons in and out of the water, so everybody stayed there as long as they wanted. I let the air out of the life ring and made sure that I could still swim for a couple of meters.
</p><p>At the end of the day, when they yelled everyone to get ashore because we were leaving, I tarried a bit for the final check that the skill remained with me and gratefully uttered in my mind, “Thank you, the Sominsky lake!”
</p><p>The next time, they took us to the Lake of Glubotskoye. The elder platoons said it was even better because the lake had a beach and sandy bottom. The way over there was much longer but asphalted, and we were going by bus so I was not sick at all.
</p><p>Yay! What a huge lake it was! They said channels were connecting it to other lakes visited by passenger boats with excursions to the Ant Island. The island was so big that long ago there was a monastery surrounded with the forest full of giant ant-heaps. Whenever any of the monks was not behaving, they tied him up and dropped onto an ant-heap. The ants thought they got under attack and hurried out to defend their city, so in just one day they gnawed the punished away, leaving only his polished skeleton.
</p><p>But from the bathing place neither boats nor islands were seen, only the very distant opposite shore. Yet, the bottom turned out sandy indeed, firm and pleasant to step along, only you had to wade and wade on before you reached a place deep enough for swimming.
</p><p>When wading back, I deeply cut my feet near the big toe. The cut was bleeding profusely and on the shore, they bandaged it at once. A dark spot showed through the bandage, but the blood stopped oozing.
</p><p>They yelled to everyone about the beach to be cautious, and then one of the adults found a broken bottle in the sandy bottom and threw it farther away in the direction of the opposite shore, but it did not console me. On the way back, I even began to whimper because it was so unfair that in the whole bus just only one foot got cut, that of mine.
</p><p>One of the caretakers told me, “What a shame! Are you a guy or a dishrag?”
</p><p>The question stopped my sniveling, and in my subsequent life, I mulishly pretended not to feel pain and  feigned being fine…
</p><p>Twice per shift, we were taken to the bath-house in the nearby village of Pistovo.
 The first time I missed because I went back to the platoon ward to pick the forgotten bar of soap, and when I came running back, the buses had already left.</p><p> The camp became quiet and empty, there remained only the cooks at the canteen and me. You could do whatever you wanted and go wherever you wished, even to the tents of First Platoon with iron beds on the raw floor-boards, where the finely carved shadows of the nearby tree foliage  danced upon the sun-warmed canvas walls. But I, for some reason, climbed upon the narrow booth of planks with an iron barrel on its top.
</p><p>It was the shower for the caretakers and pioneer leaders, who filled the barrel with pails of water for the sun to heat it.
The whole two-hour solitude I spent atop that booth, wandering along the narrow beams supporting the barrel, until the camp returned from Pistovo…
</p><p>And I did not miss the second visit to the bath-house, but it disappointed me – the huge unbearably noisy room  had no baths at all! You had to wash yourself throwing water up at you from a tin basin with tin ears for grabbing when carried.
</p><p>On the wall, there were two taps, side by side, one with boiling hot water, the other with cold. You put your basin on a low table beneath the taps but  it was hard to mix their waters to your liking because the line of boys  with their empty basins yelled from behind your back to be quick…
</p><p>The shift at the camp traditionally ended with the Farewell Bonfire which was built near the edge of the forest behind the barbed wire where ended the field with the rusty mast of the never-used attraction.
</p><p>After the breakfast in the morning, the senior platoons marched to that forest through a temporarily passage in the barbed wire fence and harvested dry firewood for the Farewell Bonfire. The harvesting went on after the "stiff hour" too and by the evening on the field edge accumulated a heap of dry branches taller than a grown-up man.
 In the dusk of the nearing summer night, that heap was set on fire from all sides and burnt with high flames under our choral songs, and the marches from the accordionist.
</p><p>Then Camp Director and the caretakers began to argue with agitated voices. In the end, Camp Director agreed and gave the orders to his chauffeur. The man answered: “If you wish so,” walked to the camp buildings, and drove back by the Camp Director’s car.
</p><p>From the trunk, the chauffeur took a metal canister while the pioneers were ordered to step back from the fire. He splashed onto it from the canister, and a huge ball of red-and-black flame buzzed and swirled up in the night, for at least three meters high, and then fell back again until the next splash.
<br>In the morning, the buses were taking us home…
</p><p>However, the end of the camp shift did not mean the end of summer. And again there was the Rechka river and playing War-Mommy, Cossacks-and-Robbers, American Ball, and Twelve Chips, as well as the new adventures, borrowed from the Detachment’s Library. However, besides the travels to distant planets and mysterious islands started from the opposite armrests of the big sofa, I also wandered in the forest for quite a few different reasons.
</p><p>For instance, our neighbor Yura Zimin suggested going there to harvest the Hare Cabbage, and I grew curious about the unheard-of vegetable. Well, though sour it still was tasty but picking it turned a literal toil because its leaves were so too tiny.
</p><p>Or else, my sister Natasha would bring the news that in the swamp behind the next block, there were myriads of blueberries, and one boy brought home a whole milk-can of them! Now, the spirit of competition drove me to the same swamp, I had to collect more blueberries than any “one boy”…
</p><p>But usually, I wandered there alone and almost without any purpose; well, except for hunting a juniper to make another good bow, or collecting green pine cones for all sorts of hand-crafted toys.
</p><p>Stick four matches into a green cone and here you have the body of a quadruped.
 To the body standing on all the four, add a vertical match as the would-be neck, pierce a smaller cone and spit it with the ‘neck’ match – wow! – you’ve got a horse now! Just don’t forget to attach a tail to it.
</p><p>After green cones, you have to climb up young pine trees, whose light-brown bark peels off all too easily to smear your hands with sticky colorless resin, which a few minutes later turns into blackish spots all over your palms, while on your pants it stays as white stains, yet still as sticky as your blackened hands.
</p><p>The young pine trees are swaying with the wind and under your weight – yea hoo! Super whooper! And their cones are so nice: green scales pressed densely to each other, all glossy as if lacquered, so different to the cones picked on the ground under  big old trees whose cones also got old and black with their scales ruffled and sticking loosely all apart. Yet, even in big pines, you could find green cones as well, only they were hanging from the very tips of those boughs where you couldn't climb or pull and bend closer to the branch you’re sitting on because they're way too thick…</p>
