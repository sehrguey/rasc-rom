<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Solitary Barge Hauler<br>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p>
</p><p>But enough of that, let's return to  Lenochka's try at fixing the dismally wrong situation of having no normal dad...
She entered the room and sat on my lap, cutting me off the desk with the opened dictionary, a copybook, and a <em>Morning Star </em> issue on it.
Turning her face up at me, she raised her hand and fondled my cheek with her small palm. Probably, she tried to show her austere father how to do the trick.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...what pushed me off?
Fear of falling to incest?
Not a chance, with my built-in robotic self-control.
</p><p>Most likely, the pitiful smile on her face saying "Oh, you poor thing!" put my back up...)
</p></div><p>"Well, enough, Lenochka, I have to work."
</p><p>The smile gave way to a sullen look,  she pouted and started to bound in revenge, still sitting on my lap.
</p><p>"What?! Dreams of sweetmeats? Ain't it a bit early?" And I rose to my feet, like a soulless robot, leaving her without the pad for bouncing.
</p><p>Several days later, coming back from work, I noticed a change on the bookshelves. There appeared a black hole.
The high cheekbone in Eera's face, on the amateur photo in the middle of the stream, was punched through. The tool of that vandalism and, maybe, even Voodooism served a sharp pencil or, possibly, a ballpoint pen.
I did not dwell on the question: who? – it didn’t matter.
</p><p>"Lenochka, come here!"
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"As a father, I have to take care of your education, so that you understand what is what. Now, look at the photo on the shelf.”
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"This is called 'baseness'."
</p><p>"It's not me."
</p><p>"I am not saying it's you. Just remember what 'baseness' is. And it makes no difference who does it."
</p><p>The photo had to be taken to the studio opposite Loony. Their employee Arthur, a young Armenian specializing in the transfer of photo portraits to ceramics, said the hole was fixable.
Only I asked to enlarge the picture to the size of a wall portrait, leaving everything as it was, and the stream too...
For the restored and enlarged photo, I also bought a cardboard frame and put it back on the shelf.
</p><p>Seeing the result, my mother gave out an icky snigger, and that was her only comment.
I did not start any pedagogical conversations on the topic, and the photo remained completely immune to malicious attempts and stood there for the dust to gradually set in…
</p><p>On the eve of the anniversary of her son Andrey, my sister Natasha complained it was impossible to find a railway model even for the ready money.
Did I remember the huge circle of tiny rails with a miniature train running along, back at the Object?
</p><p>I had vague childhood memories of the beautiful toy and picked her complaint up as an excuse to break out of everyday Konotop life. I was a loving uncle after all!.
</p><p>For a start, I went to Kiev.
The saleswoman at the specialized department store "Kids' World" sat glumly behind the counter in a black padded jacket of workmen over her blue coat of the specialized store uniform.
She perked up a bit when I reported her that I was looking for a chuff-chuff.
 She chuckled and answered in a villagers' parlance, so that the churl of me would get it, "Ain't a-having no chuff-chuffs."
It did not surprise me though because what Natasha said would always be so.
</p><p>The next detail,  pulled into the plan, became the capital of our mutual Motherland – Moscow. That's where led the caravan trails trodden by those exasperated with empty store shelves in the semi-deserts of chronic deficit…
In the metropolitan "Kids' World," there were chuff-chuffs with cars, and rails, and bridges so that the train could run along, powered by a tiny battery.
I took the prey to the railway station, stored it in an automatic storage cell, and returned downtown to snatch my share of the cultural life.
</p><p>At the ticket office of the Bolshoi Theater, I was told that their tickets had to be reserved two weeks beforehand.
A little disappointed, I left the glorious hotbed of culture discriminating against flotsam loving uncles.
</p><p>Right outside, on the sidewalk, there stood a glass cubic booth entirely curtained from inside with all sorts of show bills, in which they sold tickets to the theaters and concert halls of the Moscow City.
For the coming night, they offered to choose from the concert of leading pop stars in the Kremlin Hall and a jazz band concert at the Central Theater of the Soviet Army.
So I could visit the Kremlin for the staple stale garbage they poured for years on TV, or...
"Jazz, of course!"
</p><div id="span"><p>(...they say that the railway station in Chernigov was built under the Germans, during the occupation.
And I trust those sayers.
Why? Well, at least for the fact, that they are not paid for the gossip, unlike many compilers of countless Soviet history books.
</p><p>And they say also, the bird-eye view of the Chernigov station presents a Teutonic cross.
I had never considered the building in question from above, yet I can testify that from all the stations visited by me, only there any time of the day you could have ready boiling water from a big copper tap...)
</p></div><p>And all that reminds me, that the building of the Central Theater of the Soviet Army looks like a five-pointed star, if you fly over that pentacle and have time to cast a look down, so the hearsay...
Inside, it had a massive interior with a large hall on the first floor, and the exhibition stands in the wide galleries on the second.
</p><p>I scrupulously examined the exhibition of envelopes and matchbox stickers issued during the Great Patriotic War, because I arrived there two hours before the concert. And what else could I do in the unfamiliar winter Moscow?
The pictures on the envelopes and stickers, with all their naive primitiveness, seemed nostalgically appealing because I grew up on black-and-white movies of that period.
</p><p>Then I went down to the hall, where the jazzmen soon began to install and check their instruments on stage – the drummer kit, the vibraphone, the speakers...
Having finished these preparations, the musicians attacked the bold Jewish man for coming so too late.
 He drove a fool to them about hardships of Moscow life, and then went on a counterattack threatening on one of those days to give up all that music altogether, and let anyone give him a good reason why he needed all that at all.
They left the stage, and the hall began to slowly fill up. For the audience of about a hundred jazz lovers, the rows of violet  soft plush chairs in the hall were more than enough.
</p><p>And the concert started...
The announcer was a tall fat girl who also sang at times.
I took in one number after another and wanted only one thing – let them not end.
What Dixieland the vibraphone sounded! And what a bass guitar!
Once the guitarist was left alone with the girl and his bass guitar and they, just three of them, performed such a blues on the wide empty stage!.
</p><p>The Jew came out only once, he played a tom-tom.
Played?!. The whole of Africa would not be able to give out on their drums anything like to that number.
I forgave him for his bald head and dumb talk before the concert because he turned into a completely different person. He forgot that he did not need it and created rhythms filling you with joyously spumescent thrill.
"Bravo!"
</p><p>Apparently, in the Central Theater of the Soviet Army, aka TTSA, they held another event, parallel to the concert, because to the barrier in the cloakroom there also crowed officers in uniform, who had not been present at the performance.
The cloakroom attendant girl brought two clothes at once, and put them on the counter: a Generals' greatcoat with red silk lining and karakul collar (so this withered mushroom on my right is a General?) and the camel demi-saison hair from Alyosha Ocheret.
She laid them down on the barrier and gave a  weeny wistful sigh.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...and what are we to do?
The everyday insoluble conundrum – either a hussar in his prime, yet without a kopeck in his pocket, or a busted disrepair of  General with a secured income.
</p><p>Everyone has levers to please the ladies in sighing mood, it's only that those levers are located in different spheres...)
</p></div><p>Moscow taxi drivers were more professional than their Kiev counterparts. Anyway, the one who picked me up after the concert, having estimated my look and lack of hand luggage, guessed to take me to a hotel where they did not start the fiddle-fart talk about reservations.
The hotel "Polar" was starting from the sidewalk and getting lost somewhere up there in the darkness. The receptionist sent me by elevator to unimaginable heights between the twelfth and sixteenth floors.<br>
