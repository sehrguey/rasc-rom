<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Ivory Tower<br>&nbsp;</h3>

     <p>
And all the same, up to At-Seven-Winds I got half-hour ahead of time and decided to keep my long-standing promise to myself, that one of those days I’d come on a visit to that family of tall birch trees in the vast area of construction sites...
Following the trail trod in the tall grass, I approached the group of the white-trunk beauties.
</p><p>Stupid bitches! The tenants from the nearest street who made a garbage dump under the trees.
Scrunched between the closing in cloud layers, the sun went down like a bulb, without a sunset.
Clenching my teeth at the ugly discovery, I took my stupid bouquet to the address, for principle's sake.
</p><p>"Oh!" she said. "Even with flowers!"
</p><p>And I both immediately and too late got it that it should have been vodka...
Then we chattered about nothing in the kitchen of her one-room flat.
After tea, there happened an incident – the big jar of strawberry jam slipped from her hands and thwacked against the floor. It took her a considerable time to collect the large sticky puddle and wash the floor in the kitchen.
</p><p>At about eleven she started sending me home. I had to drive a fool that everything there was locked and latched already, and the wolfhounds set free to run around.
She, like, took pity and granted me half of her double bed, on the condition that I would behave.
</p><p>When she put the light out and also lay down, I endeavored to continue the relationship in the most natural way, which move was met with unyielding resistance.
I would never learn nothing! Did she call me for to wallow in demonstration of her chastity?
I dropped trying and felt I didn't really care, just like about that sealed post package on my bookshelves.
</p><p>...probably because the loss of jam was  too great a shock... the three-liter jar would have seen her for at least through half the winter... or maybe a dire sign for the superstitious…
 and I don't care those morons have made their stupid dump there… when from one or another construction site I  watched them waving at me it  somehow eased... like a promise of something nice...
 when they eventually will cut them down and replace with a five-story block the trees will all the same be waving their tops like saying "Hi!" through the heat haze...  it will stay by me and those smarties stuck in their garbage heap for life...
</p><p>In the dead of night, I awoke because light cautious fingers were feeling my penis through the underpants. The nurse, after the failure to get raped, was checking why so. She'd better ask the sand on the Seim beach...
But those frisking fingers of a stranger checking my flesh... It had already been somewhere...
Only I couldn't recollect where and when before falling  asleep again.
</p><p>In the morning I left, declining the proposed tea with sugar.
What was her name? She should have one anyway... it was some easy name, yes, sure... see? I even snap my fingers... now... well... er... perhaps... something like...  mmm... yes…
</p><p>The dance-floor in the Central Park of Recreation was all that still remained there for me. And I visited it not as a belated shooter in search for game but simply to get blues. A session of nostalgia  priced  50 kopecks.
</p><p>I was one of the first to enter the round enclosure of the dance-floor and get seated onto the bench of timber beams running along the tall pipe-grates in the peeling-off coat of silver-gray.
The large black boxes of the loudspeakers on the stage thundered with trendy records because "live" music became bygones.
Between the numbers some, like, DJ switched the mike on and announced what had just been played and what was coming next. At times, he attempted at making a clumsy cockamamie joke, fortunately, not too often.
</p><p>I sat quietly, the back of my head  rested against the iron pipe of the fencing. The twilight closed in   but high in the sky the flocks of swifts still revolved beneath the clouds touched by the parting sun rays. I recollected their carousel on that day when you turned one month old, and we brought you for a checkup in the children's polyclinic, in the hand-me-down carriage under the tulle cover to throw off the evil eye.
Only those swifts kept chirping shrilly when circling above the roof of the department store, while these near the fading clouds were not heard because of being so far and high.
</p><p>Then the sky became dark, the night fell, and I still sat on the bench and never danced because I knew my place which was among the other thirty-and-over-year olds outside, under the lamp in the nearby alley.
You might stop there for a couple of minutes to watch the jumping joy of the next generation before going back to your settled life with a davenport opposite the TV…
</p><p>I sat quietly as becomes a foreign particle, listened to the music and watched, point-blank, the young stock mass getting gradually denser in front of the bench... that girl's neck is longer than that of Nephertiti... very nice, like a lithe stem of dandelion...
 And I admired it without getting aroused.
Then she did not show up for a couple of weekends before coming back with her neck drooped guiltily  and obviously shortened, and I knew that she got cut off at the entrance examinations to an institute...
</p><p>At eleven, in the general throng, I left the park for the streetcar stop by Peace Square.
Those who lived closer diverged from the common flow in pairs and groups. People from far-off  neighborhoods discussed: to wait or not to wait? Streetcars at that time of day were an avis rara.
</p><p>Once the stop was occupied by a glass-eyed mujik of about forty.
He eyed the approaching youngsters with a scornful stare, akimbo, his palms on his buttocks, in the attitude of a Nazi officer by the death camp gate bearing the inscription "Forget all hope you who come in here".
The scared pairs and small companies got silent and bypassed him to timidly cram in the remaining half of the long stop. Triumphantly stood he, feet planted wide apart into the conquered living space alonside the track rails...
</p><p>I stopped in front of the victor, barely two meters away.
</p><p>...so, Sturmbahnfuhrer, dueling of attitudes, eh?.
</p><p>Mine came all of itself, from the newsreels of the Victory Parade in Moscow, 1945. Besides the dumping fascist banners to the Lenin Mausoleum, there were footages with filmed civilians, girls for the most part with their faces so sad.
Almost all of those girls from the past assumed the same posture – the left arms hanging alongside the body, the right raised across the stomach to grip the  left elbow.
</p><p>Facing the glass-eyed, I replicated their stance. Only my right hand was clutching higher than by those sad girls, around my left biceps and because of that my hanging down left arm became kinda trunk already, sort of proboscis at rest.
The opponent was not fit to withstand even one minute. He dropped his head in desperation, clasped his hands behind in the traditional <em>zek </em>attitude, and began to pace in shortened steps across the asphalted width of the stop, as far as the walls of invisible cell let him go.
</p><p>The young folks were amazed at the ease of my victory over the cockroach, and they began to fill the whole stop, taking note for the future, that knowhow is power...
Yet, to be honest, my deed was pure improvisation, a fluky present from my generation to theirs…
</p><p>Over and over again, clattering wheels beneath the floor rock the car in shallow sways, the local train carries me away from Konotop...
But where, by the way, am I going?
By all that black-ink darkness outside the window, it’s a late local train, so my trip is no farther than to Nezhin, which means I’m paying another visit to Zhomnir...
</p><p>My fuzzy reflection in the double-glazed window dimly nods in time with the rhythm of tapping at the rail joints: yea-to-him-and-no-where-else...
Why do I go there? Well, probably, there is some reason… Say, typing with his typewriter another story, or maybe a couple of verses...
</p><div id="span"><p>(...how can I now recollect from such a distance?..)
</p></div><p>But all that's nothing but a downright smoke screen, and there's no use to tell lies to oneself.
In fact, I am going to feel, again and again,  the aching longing for the lost irreversibly. I am going to torture myself on the bank of invisible river, that same river in which, eternity before, there splashed a ripple where I loved and was loved in response...
That's why the train rumbles along, through the night, and in one of its cars I'm sitting on the edge of a three-person seat, while my briefcase basks impudently, smack in the middle of it.
</p><p>It's a rare occasion when the car is empty; well, almost so. About twenty meters from my place, in a seat on the same side from the aisle, a girl is sitting.
Because of riding backward, she’s facing me with her head leaned against the black window glass.
At such a distance I cannot make out the features of her face, it's just a girl, alone in an empty car of a night train, with a bob cut of blond hair.
She does not care about my presence, but looks quietly through the window, where the picture of nocturnal darkness is sweeping past behind the dim reflection of the lamps in the ceiling of the empty car.
Of course, it is empty. I am of no account, I sit quietly in the distance and do not stare at her at all.
My absent gaze is directed along the aisle into the empty car vestibule behind the glass of the sliding door, trembling and quaking in time with the thuds of train wheels. Though such attitude doesn't, of course, prevent a sentimental corner of my eye from catching the outline of her blond head and the upper part of her shoulders visible above the series of the seat-backs separating us.
Just two in an empty car rushing through the night...
</p><p>But—lo!—she wakes up from her sad stupor. The right hand touches her blond haircut. She turns a bit deeper to the window, demonstrating her profile, and then looks straight ahead with her face turned to me.
</p><p>From my place, I can't see where exactly her eyes are directed, yet I don't need  any longer to show interest in the empty vestibule. Now I look at her and admire, with platonic frankness, the face turned to my side and her shoulders beneath the cloth of her cloak.
That's all I can do; I will not let her down with too daring jokes or suggestions, like, "You're cute, I'm cool, be my third wife..."
But – ah! – she's so nice! Even at this distanced semi-discernibility...
</p><p>The clattering of wheels fades into background, replaced with the beautiful melody by Tariverdiev from the soundtrack to the series of "17 Moments of Spring".
It's when the secret agent Isaev, aka Stirlitz, had a meeting with his wife, arranged by the Center at a small café in Germany.
</p><p>She got seated three tables away from him so that he could admire her after a decade of separation.
How's she getting on in the already unknown to him USSR? For ten dangerous years, he was away from his country, away from her...
</p><p>But sweeping away all the thoughts not needed at that moment, he only looked observing stealthily the new features in the half-unfamiliar woman.
More! Please, more!.
</p><p>But no, the time is up. Another Soviet secret agent, her escort sitting by her side, looked at his watch. The undercover meeting's over. And he took her away so that the bloodhounds of the Gestapo wouldn't   run them down…
</p><p>Yet here, in the local train car, Tariverdiev's melody does not abate, we are out of their control, alone in the whole secluded...
</p><p class="centered3 bold">BRENNGG! ZPRTYCH !!
</p><p>From among the leatherette backrests between us, like from a slightly sloped deck of cards, a red joker jumps out.
We were not alone!. That drunk has been sleeping between us all along!
</p><p>Swollen with the hangover, his red mug semaphores: "The remote flirtation is over!"
</p><p>Oh, gods!  I did  roll in the aisles in a fit of horse-laughter! With all the stops pulled out.
</p><p>Through his cloudy ignorance, watched the drunk my convulsions, then he looked back at the girl, slap-wiped his mouth with his paw and stiffly shoved off to the vestibule, and then to the next car. His delicate nature revolted against traveling in the same car with screaming quadrupeds.
</p><p>And you are so right, alky! To each his own.
It’s time to knock off the mopish shit...</p>
