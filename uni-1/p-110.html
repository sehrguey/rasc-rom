  <p>The stoker-house of the Military Detachment 41769, aka VSO-11, consisted of two high halls in a red-brick one-story building.
  Each of the halls contained two massive boilers sharing their common refractive brick lining, and a host of all kinds of pipes with valves and cocks – for hot water, for cold water, for steam, for fuel supply...
  On the concrete floor before each boiler, there was planted an air pump motor forcing the fuel to spray from the nozzle inside the respective furnace. However, only one boiler was in permanent operation, the farthermost from the entrance, all the remaining ones were reserved for the heating season in winter.
</p><p>The stokers' task in summer was to provide steam for cooking boilers in the kitchen of the Canteen plus hot water for the Dishwashers'. And, once a month, we heated water for the bath of all the servicemen at VSO-11 and Separate Company.
  Anyway, each day you had to sit at a round table beneath the high window opposite the deafening rumble of the air pump and the wailing buzz of the nozzle flame in the boiler furnace for about four hours until the on-duty cook knocked on the locked door of the stoker-house to say the havvage was ready. Then you could turn it off. The runs for breakfast and supper were shorter though.
  Silence is an invaluable grace… Until one of the remaining two, shorter, 2-hour stretches.
  </p><p>To the right from the entrance door, there was a narrow room of the pumping section to drive hot water through the heating system in winter. But if going straight ahead, in the corner behind the twinned boilers of the first hall, you found the door to a small workshop.
  There was a window, a wooden workbench without a vice placed by the butt wall across the room, an iron box in the corner between the door and the window, containing a hammer and a blunt chisel, plus a narrow piece of a mirror embedded in the plaster above the box, next to the switch of the electric bulb in the ceiling.
</p><p>The arrival of summer was celebrated by the<em> chmo </em>of VSO-11 with a collective booze.
  The battalion's truck delivering<em> havvage</em> to the watchmen at the construction sites and those kept there even at night by urgent works came back with a box of vodka smuggled utilizing a huge thermos pot emptied of <em>havvage.</em> The on-duty officer at the checkpoint cast a fleeting glance into the back of the returning truck, and it passed the gate.
  </p><p>The orgy, to which I also was invited because a stoker is a necessary accessory in the soldiery life, started after the lights-out near the remote car-boxes.
  In the bright illumination from the full moon, some fifteen <em>chmo</em>men sat on the ground in a wide circle, kinda aboriginal tribe of that field. Everyone faced the center of the circle where the glass of vodka bottles, and the sides of two pots full of meat fried by cooks in large baking trays at the Canteen kitchen, glistened in the moonlight. On the spread burlap of two empty sacks there piled several loaves of bread chopped in the Bread-Cutter's.
  Never before I had vodka from the bottle’s neck. The initial gulps were somewhat disgusting but the following kept pouring in smoothly.
</p><p>The snack, regrettably, disappeared all too soon...
  I never finished the bottle in my hand. Having risen on unsteady legs, with the best wishes to the honest company, I informed of the immediate departure of me to the village of Demino.
  </p><p>"All's nyshtyak, buddy-bros. What fucki' on-dut' what fucki' office..rr... It's me on-dut'.... fuck!.."
  </p><p>Nevertheless, so as not to run into, I crossed the perimeter fence near the pigsty, away from the barracks. And there I made for the round face of the full moon that shone from above the distant village of Demino and was swaying back and forth like on a swing.
  I muttered reproaches to its treacherous inconstancy, and to the field as well for arranging a sea-rolling in my way. Then I fell down and tried to hoist me on my elbows but the earth gravity proved too powerful and the field was so irresistibly soft…
</p><p>I woke up in the dusk of dawn, only a hundred meters from the pigsty, dying from thirst, and went back to drink water from the tap in the stoker-house before crashing onto the workbench in the workshop room...
  </p><p>It seemed like I gave too free rein to my wishful thinking, imagining that till my service end  I would live my life between the Club and the stoker-house.
  On the morning after one of the night shifts, Major Avetissian found me asleep in the workshop and ordered to retreat to the Company barrack.
  And that at the time when  the majority of <em>chmo</em>men were free to skip even the evening roll-calls!
  Thus, the soldier-clerk from the Stuff half-barrack slept at the Medical Unit hosted by the the paramedic assistant sharing a bed from the couple of normal ones forseen for ill personnel whom he escourted to the sity military hospital the moment they popped up with health complains. The Club painter Lopatko had a room of his own at the Club.
  But the ill-fated stoker, after sitting all day in that howling hell of the stoker-house, had to go for the evening roll-call where instead of absent <em>chmo</em>men a voice from the ranks would shout out "on duty!" and there were no questions at all…
  </p><p>To somehow pass the time while they were cooking <em>havvage, </em>I took a book from the library in the Staff barrack, with the assistance of the Staff clerk. The book was chosen because of its thickness so that it lasted longer. <em>The Idiot </em>by Dostoevsky.
  Wow! That's the stuff! A culmination upon culmination...  After those of his works prescribed by the school curriculum, I wouldn't ever think he was writing so cool...
  And there wasn't anything else to take from the Staff library with its just one shelf of books, because reading the masterpieces of B. Polevoy or N. Ostrovsky was not worth the while after the Dostoevsky's novel.
  </p><p>At the Club, Roodko passed me a booklet <em>The Beatles in America</em> about their tour there. Some of the <em>youngs</em> brought it along with him.
  I undertook to translate it because that booklet had more pictures than the text. However, without a dictionary at hand, my school stock of vocabulary allowed me to understand it only here, there,  yet not everywhere. I filled the gaps with my wild guesses, but Roodko was happy all the same...
  </p><p>And so it went in a circle – the hiss of steam, the rumble of the air pump, the Club, the evening roll-call, and back to the Club. And in the morning all over again...
  </p><p>Here, Jafarov rushes a-galloping into the stoker-house with his eyes round and bulging,  the face as pale as the white marks on his khaki shirt back which he had fucking rubbed against some whitewashed wall.
  </p><p>"Where to hide? Chief of Staff is after me!"
  </p><p>I watched out the door and who was there but him – making for the stoker-house from the Canteen's kitchen in his boxer swagger. Jafarov barely had time to jump out through the window in the workshop into the tall grass on the other side of the stoker-house.
  "No, Comrade Major, no one was coming this way."
</p><p>But the Major’s scent would surpass that of a hunting dog, and in a moment, from behind the corner, "Ensign Jafarov! To me!"
</p><p>  Fucking caput to you, ensign, I swear by your Mommy...
  Why should Chief of Staff chase Jafar as with a fucking prick in his arse? But then, who fucking cares...
</p><p>  And in the evening there's another hunt in the field.
  The swarthy cowboys from Separate Company ran down a rat and drove it into a stub of plugged pipe there,  splashed gasoline inside and set on fire. The rat whizzed out and jumped around the field like a ball of flames and they followed running – some cultural and sports event...
</p><p>  When it was my night shift, I saw a brood of rats in the passage around the twinned boilers. I hollered and rushed to trample them, but they fled.
  And then I wondered what caused that sudden rat-hate to crop up in me?.
  The pure instinct of self-preservation it was. Rats would not forgive the humans, including me as well, the death in flames of that rat martyr, so to prevent their avenge I attacked first. Fucking moron…
</p><p>  One night I was sleeping on the workbench when some strange thing lit on my chest. Some dark one like a clot of black fog, sort of, and it pressed to strangle me.
  I wanted to brush it off but had no strength even to stir or at least scream it away as if all of my strength got wrung out of me or paralyzed. It took a desperate effort to wake up.
  </p><p>Later Vanya, putting on a look of an expert, began to lecture me it was a bogey.
  They're just fucking stupid in that Crimea of theirs. Bogeys live at folks' homes, right? The stoker-house is anything but a home. Where could a bogey pop up here from, eh?.
</p><p>  What I omitted to tell Vanya was that the creature sat right in that place on my chest which I had shaved with the safety razor  in front of the mirror piece embedded in the wall plaster.
  Well, to get a macho look, of course, because what I had there was no more  than the hairs on Vanya's upper lip. But it fucking did not work and the chest remained unchanged, smooth and bare…  </p>
