 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Youth<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>The newcomers who bought Pilluta's half-<em>khutta</em> had been recruited to Siberia neither from Konotop nor even from Ukraine. They spoke Russian and did not understand many local words.
 There were four of them – two childless couples, who divided the half-<em>khutta</em> in further even halves. The somewhat older pair dwelled in the <em>khutta</em> next to ours, and the younger ones got the part with two additional windows looking into the street. Maybe, that's why they were a little more cheerful than the older pair. Although, in contrast to demised Pillutikha, the elders looked quite friendly too.
 </p><p>Our immediate neighbor, the husband in the senior couple, started the renovation of the brick stove in their kitchen and found a treasure hidden in the chimney.
  To Sasha and Natasha, as well as to the children from the neighboring <em>khutta </em>of the Turkovs, he distributed the bills of banknotes from his find.
  Those amazed me with their unheard-of face value. Earlier,   the 25-ruble note, with the gypsum bust of Lenin turned in profile, was, in my opinion, the biggest piece of money imaginable, but no! The Turkovs kids played with one-hundred and even five-hundred-ruble banknotes, the size of a handkerchief each, illustrated with antique sculptures and royal portraits in oval frames plus the vignette-like signature of the Finance Minister of the Russian Empire.
  The money of the Ukranian Central Rada from the Civil War times was also played, not as picturesque though, but the curls in the signature of Lebid-Yurchik were not inferior to those by the Czarist minister.
</p><p>By the way, there was a guy in my class whose last name was also Yurchik and by his first one &ndash; Sehrguey, like me, only he was taller and when our class lined-up for a PE lesson he stood the second in the rank. Yet, he hardly could be Minister Yurchik’s relative  because he lived in Podlipnoye; most likely they were just namesakes...
 </p><p>When Father came from work, the neighbor called him over to demonstrate the box which he found the treasure in, as well as the hollow place inside the chimney where it was hidden.
 Then Father returned home and standing in the middle of the kitchen uttered thoughtfully, "Seems, it was not only funny money there." He once again observed the stack of banknotes on the table and started recollections about his village relative on the maternal side.
</p><p> Living under the Czarist regime, the geezer  mastered the skill of printing paper money for which purpose he had a special machine-tool.
 Life smiled on him until his business failed because of thoughtless impatience.
</p><p>It happened when entertaining his brother on a visit from the city, he bought vodka from their village store. The salesman noticed that the five-ruble note he got for the commodity was leaving blue marks on his fingers – the brothers were so eagerly impatient to celebrate their meeting that the money paint was not allowed to dry up properly.
</p><p>In short, the printer man got exiled to Siberia and all his property confiscated. And his wife followed him, like those wives of revolutionary Decemberists doing their terms over there.
</p><p>"That's what love is", said Mother in an attempt at sprinkling  a pinch of sentimental spice into the all too earthy story.
 </p><p>"Bullshit!" burst Father. "The smart bitch got it that by the side of so qualified a diddler she would be even in Siberia better off  than home."
 </p><p>He gave out a content chuckle, and I also felt pleased that  in my family tree there someplace was sitting a cunning counterfeiter.
 The fact of all that taking place long ago did not really tell  on the satisfaction even if anything from before the Revolution seemed as distant as the harsh old times of epic heroes. But, of course,  in the days of Gorynych the Dragon they did not print paper money.
</p><p>A week later, Father's assumption got confirmed in a roundabout way by the husband from the younger couple (not as cheerful already as before). He shared the news that his friend disappeared in an unknown direction. After quietly quitting the job (his spouse followed the pattern), the older pair left without a goodbye to their neighbor-friends. Friendship is a smashing good thing, but hands off my tobacco, partner!
</p><p>Soon the younger, noticeably depressed, couple left too. The Pilluta's part of the <em>khutta</em> emptied again and for long…
</p><div id="span"><p>(...those acquainted with the Soviet legislation wouldn't judge the runaways too harshly, any treasure found in the USSR became the state property minus 25% of its value to the lucky finder. No John Silver would sail near such a close-shaving wind...)

</p></div><p>As a result of getting trained at the regional camp of Komsomol activists, I was elected Head of Komsomol Committee, aka Komsorg, of School 13 and for several days next week I  was free from classes. In the commission of five other Komsorgs, I had to attend the reporting sessions of Komsomol Committees in the city schools, under the supervision of Second Secretary of the City Komsomol Committee. Besides me, among the commission members, there were two more trainees from the Sumy camp: the guitar player and one of the girls.
</p><p> The reporting sessions were killing with their boredom because at every school the very same things were said the very same way in the very same words. And then Second Secretary invariably demanded from us, the commission members, to take the floor with our critical remarks...
 The guitar player was good at those stodgy pieces because of being used to strum the only two chords he knew…
</p><p>"Ever keeping aloft and honored their glorious pioneer traditions, the School 13 Komsomol members did their best and contributed their weighty share in the Yearly All-School Collecting of Scrap Metal...""
</p><p>Each autumn, half of the long rectangular schoolyard was divided into the sectors starting from the two-story "Cherevko's school" at the gate up to the workshop building. The sectors were assigned to different classes so that they knew where to dump the scrap metal collected by them.
</p><p>The classes competed, the piles of rusty stuff grew up with their augmentations checked, weighed and registered until one day the schoolyard was entered by a dump truck to move the collection away, usually in a couple of goes.
  The winner class was awarded the Honor Certificate handed to them at the nearest ceremonial school line-up.
</p><p>Of course, we hardly ever cared for those certificates. Yet, it was enticing to get together with your whole class and...well, not all of your class, actually, but those who could or were willing to turn up and...
</p><p>And with a pair of handcarts rattling their iron wheels over the raggy cobblestones in Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street, or creaking wearily along the rest–dust'n'dirt-paved–streets, we ventured into the Settlement in search of scrap metal.
  Where exactly were we looking for it? It depended.
 Sometimes a classmate reported a neighbor willing to get rid of a heap of perennial metal layers in the corner of their yard. “God bless you, kids! Drive your handcart in, take all of that away!”
</p><p>Yet, rusty basins, folding coach-bed springs, and bent nails were a too lightweight stuff to give  your grade's scrap heap much of respectability. Besides, champions for environmental purity were not an ofttimes  species in the neighborhood. “So, what's wrong about that trash behind the shed? Rusty through and through? But you never know. One of these days it might come handy. A length of wire would nicely fix a fence plank so rotten that nails crash it to pieces. Get along, kids. Go! Go!”
</p><p>That’s why the newly amalgamated collective of our ninth grade moved for a free search dollying their handcarts along the Plant wall in Professions Street... Like vultures circling in the westerns to locate a prey...
 At the far end of Plant, where the tracks of the marshaling yard multiplied innumerably, we wheeled around an obviously no man's wheel pair from a railway car. Yet, you couldn't load the multi-ton wheels on a pair of handcarts, otherwise, we'd win at the scrap metal competition in just one go.
</p><p>On we soared seeking along the railway tracks, to no avail though.
  But then the guys peeked into a wide concrete tube section lost in the tall grass alongside the railway to discover  a watermelon and a box of grapes.
</p><p>"Clear as daylight, the station loaders lifted the fruits from some car in a freight train and stashed away for a while", supposed Volodya Sakoon from the former parallel.
</p><p>We looked around more attentively at the rows of freight trains stilled silently in their tracks, immersed in the torpor of waiting...
</p><p>Some dude from our party took out a knife to cut the watermelon from the find. Yet, it did not open even when gashed all the way about its equator because of being too big for the knife length. Only when hit against the concrete tube, the watermelon broke up in two, but its core, the so-called "soul", remained in one of the halves. Moistly red, and sugary, stitched with dark brown seeds... Soul.
</p><p>I would never expect such a swiftness from myself, but it was me who dealt the "falcon strike" with both hands, snatching  the watermelon's  soul.
  Puzzled with that completely out of the blue deftness of mine, I generously refused from partaking in the remaining halves.
  The guys sliced them into handy pieces, while I enjoyed the rindless juice-dripping ball of watermelon flesh from out of my capped palms.
 </p><p>Even the girls couldn’t say “no” to the grapes, yet almost half of the box, we left for the absent loaders who stole them so that they did not feel offended...
 </p><p>An hour later, following the lead from a stray acquaintance, we stroke it real rich on a scrap metal deposit, although at an entirely different spot...
 In the fence of iron pipes separating Bazaar from the Seminary, aka Vocational School 4, there was a hole through which we dragged out lots of iron pipe offcuts, long and numerous enough to make a good load for both handcarts.
</p><p>Next day the House Manager of Seminary came to our school, identified their pipes in the scrap metal heap collected by our grade, and took them away by a dump truck. He asserted they served as the material for training seminarians in the turners group.
 However, our Principal, Pyotr Ivanovich, did not even scold us.
But then what for? How could you guess the purpose of material dumped into the thicket of nettle?
</p><p>Nonetheless, when giving it a careful thought, you'd always find a good underlying reason for anything. And only my lightning-fast seizure of the watermelon's soul remained completely inexplicable for me.
 </p><div id="span"><p>(....in those irrevocably faraway times—past any reach, recall, redress—I hadn't realized yet that all my grieves and joys, ups, and downs, all my silly mistakes, and breathtaking insights sprang from that rascal in the unfathomably distant future who’s now composing this letter to you stretched on my back inside this here one-person tent surrounded by a dark forest in the middle of nowhere and the never subsiding whoosh of the river  currently named Varanda...)</p>
