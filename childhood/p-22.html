<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>That summer the boys from our Block began to play with yellowish cartridges of real firearms which they were hunting at the shooting range in the forest. I wanted so badly to see what shooting range might look like, yet bigger boys explained that you could visit it only on special days when there was no shooting because on any other day they’d shoo you off.
</p><p>It took a long wait for a special day, but after all, it came and we went through the forest...
 The shooting range was a vast opening about a huge rectangular excavation with a steep cave-in in one of the corners to get down there. The opposite wall of the pit was screened with a tall log barrier, all poked with bullets, bearing rare shreds of forgotten paper squares with gravely riddled outline of man’s head-and-shoulders.
</p><p>We looked for the cartridges in the sand underfoot. They were of two types – longish, neck-narrowed, cartridges from the AK assault-rifle; and small straight cylinders from the TT pistol. The finds were loudly welcomed and busily exchanged between the boys. I had no luck at all and only envied the luckier seekers whose shrieks sounded flat and suppressed by the eerie silence of the shooting range displeased with our trespassing the forbidden grounds…
</p><p>Besides the excavated hollow, the glade was cut with a front-line trench whose sandy walls were kept in place by board shields. A narrow track of iron rails ran from one end of the opening to the other crossing, on the way,   the trench over. It was the railway for a large plywood mock-up of tank mounted upon its trolley rumbling along the track when hauled with the hand winch cable.
</p><p>The boys started to play with all those things. I also sat in the trench once, while the plywood tank clanged overhead, and then I went to the call from the edge of the field where they needed my help.
</p><p>We pulled the steel cable looped through the horizontal pulley to make it easier for the boys on the other end of the battlefield to turn the handle of the winch which set in motion the trolley with the tank.
</p><p>At some point, I got inattentive and failed to to pull my hand back in time, the cable was quick to snatch and drag my little finger into the wheel groove.
 The pain in the squeezed finger  made me toss out an agonizing scream together with a fountain of tears.
</p><p>Hearing my “oy-oy-oy!” as well as the shouts of other boys around me, “Stop! Finger!”, the winch operators managed to stop it when there remained a mere couple of centimeters for my little finger to pass the pulley turn and get out. They wound the winch handle in the opposite direction, dragging my little finger back to where it was originally swallowed by the device.
</p><p>The unnaturally flattened, dead pale finger smeared with the blood from the broken skin, emerged from the pulley jaws and puffed up instantly.
</p><p>The boys wrapped it with my handkerchief and told me to run home. Quick!
 And I ran through the forest feeling the painful beat of the pulse in the burning finger…
</p><p>At home, Mom, without asking anything, at once told me to put the wounded in the gush of water from the kitchen tap. She bent and straightened it several times and ordered not to bellow like a little cow.
</p><p>Then she bandaged it into a tight white cocoon and said that by the wedding day it would be like new.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…and at the same time, childhood is not the nursery of sadomasochism, like, “Whoops, my finger got pinched! Oh, I bumped my head!”
 It’s just that some jolts leave deeper notches in the memory.
</p><p>Yet, what a pity that the same memory does not retain the admiring state of ongoing discoveries when a speck of sand stuck to a penknife's blade holds countless galaxies and worlds, when every trifle, a scrap of trash, is the promise and pledge of future wanderings and unbelievable adventures.
</p><p>We grow up gaining the protective armor necessary in the adult world – the doctor's coat on me, the traffic cop's uniform on you. Each of us becomes a necessary cog within the social machine. All needless things—like gaping at fire extinguishers or scanning the strange faces in the frost gripped windowpane—are chopped off…
</p><p>Now there is a number of old scars on my fingers. This one from an awkwardly wielded knife, here it was cut with an ax; and only on my little fingers I cannot find any trace from that pulley injury. Because "body gets smooth"...
</p><p>But, hey! I know some fresher bywords, like that recent one, and well-said too –
</p><p class="centered3 ital">“<strong> summer is a miniature life”</strong>…)
</p></div><p>When you are a child not only summer but each and every day is a miniature life.
 The childhood time is slowed down – it does not fly, it does not flow, it does not even move until you push it on. Poor kids would long since got extinct while crossing that boundless desert of the static time, were they not rescued by playing games.
</p><p>And in that summer, if I got bored with a game or no one was in the Courtyard to play with, I had already a haven, kinda “home” square in the game of  Classlets.
</p><p>The big sofa it was, where life ran high indeed, the life full of adventures shared with the heroes in books by Gaidar, Belyaev, Jules Verne…
</p><p>However, even outside the big sofa, you could always find a place suitable for all kinds of adventures. Like the balcony by the parents’ room, where I once spent a whole summer day reading a book about prehistoric people – Chung and Poma.
</p><p>There was hair all over their bodies, like by animals, and they lived in the trees. But then a branch  accidentally broke off a tree and helped to defend themselves against a saber-tooth tiger, so they started to always carry a stick about them and walk instead of leaping in the trees around.
</p><p>Then there happened a big jungle fire followed by the Ice Age. Their tribe wandered in search of food, learning how to build fire and talk to each other.
</p><p>In the final chapter, the already old Poma could walk no farther and fell behind the tribe. Her faithful Chung stayed by her side to freeze together in the snow.
</p><p>But their children could not wait and just went on because they were already grown up and not so hairy as their parents, and they protected themselves from the cold with the skins of other animals…
</p><p>The book was not especially thick, yet I read it all day long, while the sun, arisen on the left, from behind the forest outside our Block, indiscernibly moved in the sky over the Courtyard, towards the sunset on the right, behind the second block.
</p><p>At some point, in a way of respite from the uninterrupted reading, I slipped out between the iron uprights of the handrail that bounded the balcony and started to promenade outside, along the concrete cornice beyond the safety grating, and it was not scary at all because I tightly grasped the bars, just like Chung and Poma when they were still living in the trees.
</p><p>But some unfamiliar unclie was passing down there who scolded me and told to get back onto the balcony. He even threatened to report to my parents. However, they were not home so he took his complaint to our neighbors on the first floor. In the evening they told on me to Mom, and I had to promise her to never-never do it again…</p>
