 <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
 <p>
On a Thursday, I stayed in the steam room a little longer and left the bathhouse at something past seven.
Before the rule of Gorbachev, I would not even notice it–the blissful don't follow the  flow of time–however, the Prohibition brought about rigid temporal limitations for the sale of alcohol.
But my after-bath quota?!.
</p><p>In the beer bar on the opposite side of Square of Konotop Divisions, instead of the usual bright radiance of its fluorescent lamps, a measly yellow spot of a single bulb left on inside.
In sad distress, I was passing by when the door of the bar opened and two men climbed down the high porch of the facility.
Well, well, well!. The situation called for closer inspection...
</p><p>The unlocked door yielded willingly to the light pressure. And indeed, just one 100-watt bulb was lit inside, above the beer tap. Yet, the beer was still flowing from the tap into glasses! Men were grabbing them and retreating to hang on about the tall round tables. If not for the scanty illumination, all was like in  old good dry-lawless times!
</p><p>Not everything though. The noise and din of warm friendly conversations were missing. The barman in a white garb kept warning, over and over again, from behind the counter, "Keep quiet, mujiks! And be quick, we're being breaching it."
</p><p>There's no buzz in booze under the whip-clicks of a stopwatch…
Here, in the murky half-dark dungeon room, where you couldn't make out the face of a man standing at the table opposite, we were like the last handful of Knights Templar after their order was defeated and pronounced anathema.
Here, we hid ourselves away from the alcohol-free spies and informers. Any low-grade trader could point at you and yell, "Lay hands on him! Hold fast! Call the militia!"
We were outlaws…
</p><p>Honestly, I do not really like beer bars.
You stand in the line and watch how tipsy scumbags approach the mujiks queuing ahead of you, "Bro, and a couple for me, eh?" And instead of one line, you have to stand, in fact, two or three.
Even more disgusting, when already quite close to the tap, you get a jab in your ribs and a guy who you, like, have seen someplace, giggles and winks at you, "Don't forget? I asked three mugs."
No, next time I'd rather go to a café where they sell only bottled, more expensive, beer but without those impudent tail-clingers...
And on the following bath-day Thursday, I haughtily passed by the beer bar and stomped to the café.
</p><p>"We've got no beer."
</p><p>Damn! Okay, I can go to Peace Square...
But in the café next to the cinema there also was no beer.
The railway station restaurant remained my last chance.
Same story.
But it's Thursday!
</p><p>That way I was made buy a bottle of white wine.
The tables in the restaurant were big, for about ten persons each, surrounded by heavy chairs in leather upholstery, yet almost empty of guests.
I took a seat somewhere in the middle of the hall and started to pour wine into a glass as I would do it from a bottle of beer – in a knitting-needle-thin trickle. So was my habit.
</p><p>After the first glass, I was approached by some mujik of an ambiguous occupation who asked for permission to get seated by.
The whole hall of vacant tables, and he liked this particular one. Well, I did not object.
</p><p>Landing into the next chair, he shared that he was in transit from the city of Lvov.
I answered that Lvov also was a good city, welcome in passing, and all that. And I started to fill the following glass.
</p><p>With intent stare at the thin trickle, he announced that he had just been released from Zone...
The couple of guys at the next but one table cut their gossip.
I congratulated him on being free at last and drank.
</p><p>His face got suddenly distorted with an expression of indistinct malice, and he went over to loud threats of having intercourse with my rectum when two of us would land in the same prison cell.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...all that, of course, in the most explicit straightforward terms...)
</p></div><p>The wine was finished off, the neighbor at the table obviously did not like me, and I got up to leave.
One of the guys that were sitting nearby, was already standing in between the tables. "Bang the bitch!" he said to me. "What are you waiting for? We're in!"
An absolutely unfamiliar guy, probably, he had a fit of patriotism.
</p><p>"You did not get it," answered I. "He's not local. The law of hospitality does not allow for crushing the bottle against his pate. When on a vacation I'll visit the city of Lvov and check what problem makes the travelers from there so impolite."
</p><p>I do not know if the guy understood my lengthy speech. Anyway, he returned to his table, and I went out, leaving my neighbor in front of the empty bottle by the empty glass on the empty varnish of the table.
He had resorted to the ultimate invocation, yet the magic did not work and the bottle did not turn into a scatter of fragments by a wallop against his Ascabar trained head.
But still and all, I cannot forgive it Gorbachev...
 You may ask what had Gorbachev to do with fucking my asshole?
Even in the era of  deficit and severe shortages, the bottled beer did not disappear from Konotop. Never.
</p><p>But he went loose beyond all bounds of decency and judgment and kept amending the Prohibition with new articles to toughen the struggle against alcoholism…
In the evening of the day with the fresh, stricter, measures coming into force, I went as usual to the Central Park.
However, I reached neither the dance-floor nor even the ticket office.
</p><p>In the central alley of the park, I was intercepted by a muscular stranger with a dark hair and horseshoe-shaped mustache in the style of VIA The Pesnyary.
He told that I did not know him, but he knew me because he was from KhAZ, where he worked with my brother...
</p><p>I recollected as one time my brother Sasha admiringly mentioned some former border guard fond of demonstrating miracles of acrobatics at their workplace. Probably, that was him.
</p><p>The stranger carefully held a white cellophane packet in his right hand, and he did not slap the nasty night mosquitoes but blew them off his biceps bulging out the T-shirt sleeves, by sharp puffs instead.
Just like me, another adept of non-resistance, or else that way he was trained for frontier patrols: make sure to avoid producing unnecessary sound waves betraying your location.
</p><p>Giving a slight shake to the white cellophane—to which it responded with a luring clandestine tinkle—he informed it was wine in there because he wisely procured it before the curfew. Would I keep him company?
The answer was in the affirmative.
</p><p>It looked strange to me though, when he turned to the waves of youngsters flocking to the dance-floor with the repetitive request for a knife to open a bottle.
Everyone shook their heads and some even recoiled, scared by the incongruity of the question with the general spirit of concurrent times...
But then, maybe, it was his personal form of protest against the Prohibition…
</p><p>A knife was never found, but he somehow contrived to tear the plastic cork off, by application of a beam in the bench by which we stood in the alley.
He handed the bottle to me. I said it would be better for him to start it because of a certain flaw in my brake system.
</p><p>"Never mind. I've got another in the bag," insisted he.
</p><p>Well, I had warned anyway, ain't it? And I killed the 750 ml without a trace.
</p><p>"Hmm, yes," said the companion thoughtfully. "I did not get it properly."
He uncorked the second bottle, yet refrained from giving it to me, just held in his hands, and when we sank onto the bench, he put it between us.
</p><p>We began to probe each other as to which of manifold philosophical subjects might flag off a friendly conversation.
As a rule, after the second glass, you start to give out awesomely smart things, getting astonished yourself by their unexpected wisdom.
In the end, of course, everything will slide into the eternal, slippy, gash as predicted by the truck crane driver, Ivan Kot, but why not to glitter your well-trained mind for a starter?
</p><p>Alas, the envious bad stars forestalled any shining, or sparkling, or glittering...
Along the alley, slowly and almost inaudibly, rolled up a van with inscription "militia" on the door. It stopped and two gentlemen in cockades jumped out of the cab.
</p><p>My interlocutor, not waiting for any further development in the upcoming events, without delay threw himself over the bench and started down the side alley towards the dark building of the city council.
I didn’t even think to compete him in this track and field event and, with a bottleful freshly tanked into the hold, I could only admire how quickly he was leaving.
Moreover, those two bulls were already towering above me.
</p><p>None of them followed him either, only the older officer tapped his shoe heels against the asphalt in a pretty fast step dance,  staying in the same spot though. The performance was accompanied with a strange, possibly, also Irish, air, "Oolyou-lyou!".
The border guard accelerated sharply and dissolved in  the darkness.
</p><p>The militiaman dancer picked  the open, but still not started, bottle up from the bench. He turned it upside down in his outstretched hand and held so in both sadistic and mournful attitude, while the wine gurgled out to the ground.
</p><p>"Come on," the second man said to me, nodding at the already open side door in the van...
I stuck my head inside. In the dim light of a tiny bulb in the ceiling, those invited before me sat along the blind sidewalls.
An elderly militia petty officer sat leaning his back against the partition from the cab, facing the public.
</p><p>Admiring the impeccable finesse of my own movements, I ascended the interior. The door slammed shut behind me.
"Good evening!" amiably and indiscriminately greeted I all the present, and at once got a kick in my ass.
</p><p>"The prick even 'good-evening' knows!" yelled the petty officer who hit me.
</p><p>Falling on someone from the previous catch, I automatically exclaimed, "I beg your pardon!" and  immediately looked back fearful of another kick.
It seemed, I was not going to get it for the "pardon", the officer was too lazy to get up.
</p><p>The ride was not long. Leaving the vehicle, I recognized the courtyard where The Orpheuses were brought for giving the testimony  on the disappearance of the accordion made in DDR, but now I was taken to another building.
At the desk in the corridor, there sat a militia Captain. After a couple of questions addressed to my fellow-travelers, they were sent to the cell.
</p><p>Then he turned to me. Observing that I answered his questions adequately and did not try to push for my rights nor refuted the report of the officers who delivered me, he asked where I worked.
Then he called somewhere to verify and after a very short talk as well as checking my proficiency at bending exercises, he finally ordered me to go home. "Straight home! Got it? Nowhere else!"
</p><p>I went out of the gate. Why do they all order me?
Fuck them!
And I obstinately returned to the park and bought a ticket to the dance-floor.
</p><p>To celebrate the new stage in the on-going anti-alcoholic campaign, the gate was guarded by a militia sergeant and two public order enforcers adorned with festively red armbands.
</p><p>"Did you drink today?" demanded one of them.
</p><p>"Never!" responded I and proceeded to my bench under the fence to sit there until the end of dancing.
Which happened after a couple of numbers…</p>
