<p>
The aircraft landed in the Odessa airport at midnight and I managed to be in time for the 6.00 bus from the New Bazaar bus station.
Outside the city, irresistible slumber overcame me so that I missed the stop  and  woke up only after three hundred meters past it. At my request, the driver stopped the bus at the top of the ascend, and I crossed the forest belt.
</p><p>In the garden of the outermost cottage amid the thinning dusk of the retreating night, an elderly mujik in his underwear and a woman in a white nightgown swept, for some reason, the beds with brooms.
They moved in a strange, robot-like, way. The mujik's eyes were filmed with the glassiness. I did not see the woman's eyes though, she was careful to keep them turned away.
Rather strange agricultural practices for so early an hour, but I could hardly be surprised at anything already.
</p><p>In my four-day absence, they did not bring any asphalt.
But the pinkwashed outside plaster of the old hostel walls had got spattered with blue splashes and dispersed lines as if to camouflage the barrack. But why blue?.
</p><p>I got in the everyday groove at the mine.
The weather changed because one day coming back from Odessa, I found that in my pocket remained just a single three-kopeck coin of age-blackened copper.
</p><p>"That's not money," thought I to myself and threw the coin back over my shoulder, among the trees of the forest belt.
For exactly three days thereafter, the cold wind blew from the sea, refuting my dismissive opinion of the three kopecks, and making me get the message in the expression "to throw money to the wind".
</p><p>The electrician, my neighbor opposite the corridor, died on the road from Chabanka before reaching the hostel. They found him three days later.
</p><p>I always knew that was a dangerous stretch of the road. In summer, there were constantly flying fluffy spherical balls, like to sea mines, but white and smaller, of course. Probably, one of them scraped the defunct, when he was unaware or failed dodging.
</p><p>They buried him in the village cemetery, on the cliff between the highway and the sea.
Kapitonovich was carrying a wooden cross ahead of the coffin, like a banner, but he himself had a sash of a long narrow towel tied in a diagonal loop from one of his shoulders, the way best men of grooms adorn themselves at village weddings, instead of pinning a handkerchief up the jacket sleeve as was the custom at funerals in Konotop.
What else might you expect of them? They’ve heard the song but got the wrong sow by the ear.
</p><p>In the father's pea-jacket with yellow buttons, I presented a colorful figure, like, a seaman from the black-and-white flicks "We are from Krondstadt", but I also helped to fill up the grave.
Then we were taken back to the hostel by bus.
The women from the mine office in the pit prepared the wake feast from their home supplies.
I wolfed a disgracefully enormous amount of every scoff like on the visit to the Tshombe's field camp in my student years…
</p><p>The repaired radio set was brought back to the hostel, and I had to move into the room of the diseased electrician. Soon Vasya, the new roof-fastener, joined me there.
At first, I doubted his sex, when accidentally noticed red-brown stains on his bedsheets, as if from menstruation.
He hurried to explain, that they were from a tomato that rolled under his blanket and he kicked it to squash in sleep, although I hadn't been asking about anything at all.
</p><p>That hostel's just another Bellamy Isle with everyone around reading your thoughts before you had the time to think them off.
However, what simple explanations might sometimes be found for incomprehensible, at first glance, facts…
</p><p>Autumn came into its own.
I inserted glass into the window frame of the respective room in our would-be apartment, however, they still were not bringing any asphalt...
And so it went on in its everyday manner until the moment when the chief engineer came from Vapnyarka and said that I was announced wanted at the all-Union hunt, and the mining management received a letter from the NGPI with accusations of sheltering a runaway who shirked working off at the place of his appointment.
</p><p>"Now, write the application."
</p><p>"What application?"
</p><p>"Asking to be fired on your own volition."
</p><p>"I have no  such  wish."
</p><p>"We cannot retain you here after such a letter."
</p><p>As I stubbornly negated any desire for leaving, a compromise was found, based of one of many articles in the code of labor legislation: "dismissal by agreement of the parties".
Thus, instead of a chosen, I became just a party...
</p><p>In the end, I had a parting walk about Odessa streets in the sheepskin coat wide open, like a soldier from the Peasant Army of Nestor Makhno, and in rubber boots bravely splashing across the puddles from the recent heavy rains.
When back in the hostel, I packed them in a bale with the rest of my clothes and the tools that I had already started to acquire, one by one: a hammer, an ax, a saw, an iron, an electric water heater, and a white enamel kettle.
</p><p>When I bought that kettle in Odessa, I had to sing songs all the way from New Dophinovka to the hostel so that it would not get too spooked.
It was very late, and the night was too dark, like in the abandoned shafts without the flashlight. I had to fit from memory into the bends of the country road, groping for it with my feet. It’s hard to say whether I was singing to sooth the kettle or to perk up myself.
Probably, it was more for the kettle’s sake, because fearing the dark would be a disgrace for a chosen. Anyway, we overcame that thickly pitch-black night together...
</p><p>The bale was taken to the station and sent off by a luggage car.
Then I returned to the hostel where a recently bought briefcase and sports-bag Aerobica were sitting together with the guitar, before starting to the airport the following morning.
</p><p>Slavik Aksyanov dropped into our room. We finished off a whole pan of fried potatoes under "The Bolero" by Ravel from Vasya's receiver.
I told Slavik to fix the door to the toilet booth above the sea inlet. It was kicking back in the tall grass, I had seen it there.
He swore to execute my last wish.
However, just in case, I threatened that if he did not, I would haunt him like the ghost of Hamlet's father. A genuine funk flashed in his eyes. Who would have ever supposed that even they were afraid of spooks?!.
</p><p>Eera told that they had sent a letter from the Transcarpathia to the institute, reporting my absence from the appointed school.
Gaina Mikhailovna was summoned to Rector, who demanded of her to disclose my current location. After Rector declared that in summer he had personally met me in Odessa, she was forced to give away my affiliation with the mine. Now she was going to have troubles at work, and my diploma would be taken away unless the Republican Ministry of Education annulled my appointment.
</p><p>I had to urgently go to Kiev, as far as the metro station named after Karl Marx, and up the street starting from The October Revolution Square to a gray-stone building in a row of similar ones, yet different to them by its sign of the Ministry of Education, and up the white steps of polished marble to a tall leather-lined door on the second floor…
</p><p>Head of the department in charge of shirkers, surnamed Baranov, looked five years older than me and superbly refined with the appropriate chiseling, grinding, and polishing as required by his position.
The only chink in his armor was the lonely blonde hair on the shoulder of his jacket, worn over a tight woolen waistcoat, with a glimpse of the striped necktie in the fine-grid of the pattern printed in his shirt – impierceable coat of mail.
</p><div id ="span"><p>(...yes, because the clothes we wear are not for just airing our dress-code. Their main purpose is to protect us and not only from seasons and weather, which is too trivial. First and foremost, they have to protect us from other humans  more adequately clad for the current situation.
</p><p>Remember that Yalta Conference? Stalin and Churchill in the greatcoats of higher commanders at their respective armed forces and Franklin D. Roosevelt, in between the iron-clad rhinoceroses, flashing his democratic chic?  Guess whose country had to bury their leader a couple of months later? I can’t keep back the tears of condolence watching his naive necktie and defenseless fly in the pictures.
</p><p>But then who knows? FDR might have been in a suicidal mood right then...)
</p></div><p>He glibly trotted it out that our state for four years bore expenses to give me the higher education free of charge, and it was time to compensate the charity by honest work in the Transcarpathia or say goodbye to my diploma.
</p><p>I did not waste time on useless arguing. We both knew it perfectly well that the interests of state was the ace in trump suit, there was nothing to counter it with.
  My defense was built on my passionate desire to work in the field of enlightenment of the younger generations, and nowhere else but on the slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, yet how about my family?
</p><p>He encouraged me to take you and Eera over there.
</p><p>And what about the second or, rather, first of my daughters?
</p><p>The presence of Lenochka was a surprise for him. By the force of inertia, he suggested deporting her together with the rest.
</p><p>I had to show my passport that she was a product of my previous marriage and to bitterly admit lacking  information of her mother's whereabouts.
</p><p>That was the checkmate. Großmeister Baranov had not been trained to parry such moves and, having got to Zugzwang, admitted that I had a really swirly plot.
I would get a free diploma, that is the cancellation of my obligations to return my debt to the state by honest work at the place I was appointed to if I presented the reference from the Head of Street Committee, that Lenochka did live at 13, Decemberists Street in the city of Konotop.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the bale sent from Odessa arrived at Nezhin. The tools did not impress my father-in-law, but he got delighted with the teapot strainer. It was his long-term dream to have such a one, only you could not find it in stores even for ready money...
Eera and I started discussing at which of the construction enterprises in Nezhin I should apply for a job to get an apartment as soon as possible when she suddenly said that I needed to be checked, as advised by her mother.
</p><p>I was a little surprised because of a medical check being the must when you applied for a job, even without her mother's advice.
</p><p>As it turned out, I had to understand that there was a need for special examination, to check if I was normal at all. Some traits in my behavior were giving rise to certain fears and threatened to disrepute in the public eye the otherwise totally respectable, if not for me, family of Eera's parents.
</p><p>For instance, quite recently I walked the streets in torn shoes, and I also collected every mote of dust around the baby's carriage, and any question, even of the most trivial nature, made me think for too long before answering, and when she was in the maternity hospital, I came home in the middle of night and declared that the rain was warm.
</p><p>Besides, Eera was shocked by the news from Konotop about my fanatical auto-da-fe of the cannabis plantation, which, though not included in the list of deviations, spoke volumes...</p>
 <p>I had nothing to counter with, it was the King and Queen pair from trump suit, she was right on each and every point.
