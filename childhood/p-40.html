<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>Soon after our return, Mom took Sasha and Natasha with her and went on her vacation to Konotop.
Again, Dad and I kept each other manly company of two. He cooked tasty pasta soup the Navy way and explained me things about the seamen's life.
</p><p>For instance, on ships many commands were given by the bugle calls and those signals were not just “du-du-du-du du-du-du-du” as made by a pioneer bugler, when marching together with a drummer after the Pioneer Company Banner on some ceremonial line-up. The ship bugle played a different melody for each call. At midday meal time the bugle sang, “Take your spoon, and your mess-tin, quickly run to the half-deck”.
</p><p>The mess-tin is a pot with a lid which they fill for a sailor with his grub to eat, and the half-deck is that place on the ship where the cook ladles meal out.
</p><p>Dad taught me some sea words too. “Topmast” meant the highest point on a boat.
 When they wanted to play a trick on a young sailor, they used to give him a teapot and send to fetch tea from the topmast. The greenhorn unaware, of course, where it was, walked about the boat asking the way. The seasoned sailors directed him from one place to another or to the engine room, just for fun…
</p><p>And Dad also told that some <em>zeks</em>, who spent too many years in Zone, could no longer live in freedom. Because of that one recidivist, on serving his term, pleaded Zone Chief not to let him out and keep on in. But Zone Chief replied, “The law is the law! Get lost!”
</p><p>In the evening, the recidivist was brought back to Zone because he killed a man in a nearby village. And the murderer cried, “I told you, Chief! Because of you I took an innocent soul!”
</p><p>At those words, Dad’s eyes looked sideways and up, and even the sound of his voice changed strangely…
</p><p>Some books I re-read more than once, not immediately, of course, but after some time.
 That day I was re-reading the book of stories about revolutionary Babushkin, which I was awarded at school for good studying and active participation in school public life.
 He was a common laborer and worked for rich plant owners before becoming a revolutionary…
</p><p>When Dad called me for the midday meal, I went to the kitchen, got seated at the table and, eating the pasta soup, shared, “And did you know, that before the October Revolution the workers at the Putilov factory once were forced to work for forty hours at a stretch?”
</p><p>To which Dad replied, “Did you know that your Mom went to Konotop with another man?”
</p><p>I raised my head up from the plate. Dad was sitting in front of untouched soup and looking at the kitchen window blinds.
</p><p>I got scared, and started to cry, and shouted, “I will kill him!”
</p><p>But Dad, still looking at the blinds, answered, “No, Seryozha, we don’t need no killing.”
</p><p>His voice sounded a little nasal as that of the recidivist murderer who wanted to stay in Zone.
</p><p>Then Dad got to the Detachment’s Hospital and for two days the neighbor woman, who had moved in the rooms of the redundant Zimins, was coming to our kitchen to cook meals for me.
 On the third day, Mom came back together with my sister and brother…
</p><p>Mom went to see Dad at the Detachment’s Hospital and took me with her. Dad came out to the yard in the pajamas to which they changed all the patients there.
</p><p>The parents sat on a bench and told me to go and play somewhere. I walked away but not too far, and I heard as Mom was quickly telling something to Dad in a low voice.
</p><p>He looked straight in front of himself and repeated the same words, “The kids will understand when they grow up.”
</p><div id="span"><p>(…when I grew up, I understood that some informer had sent a letter from Konotop, only that time directly to my Dad instead of the Special Department.
</p><p>What for? By telling on my Mom, the rat gained no prospect of better housing conditions or other improvements in their day-to-day life.
 Or maybe just out of habit? Or maybe that was not a neighbor at all?
</p><p>Some people, when not happy with their lives, think it will help if someone else does badly. I do not think it works, but I know that there are such thinkers.
</p><p>And I never asked my brother or sister about the man who went with them to Konotop that summer. Nonetheless, now I know that so it was.
</p><p>Mom built her defense on Dad’s frivolous behavior during his vacation the previous year, when he went alone to a Crimean sanatorium on the admission card from the trade-union. He got so light-minded there that never thought to get rid of his light-mindedness evidence, and Mom had to wash  that evidence out from his underpants in the washing machine “Oka”…)
</p></div><p>Then Dad left the Hospital and we started to live on further…
</p><p>At school, our sixth grade was moved back onto the second floor in the main building. With reading books and watching the television I had no time for home assignments but still remained a “good learner” just out of teachers’ inertia.
</p><p>In the school public life, I played the role of a horse in the performance staged by the pioneers of our school. The role was assigned to me because Dad made a big horse head from cardboard and on stage I represented the horse’s head and forelegs. My arms and shoulders were hidden under a large colorful shawl, which also covered one more boy who crouched behind me gripping my belt because he played the role of the hinder-parts.
</p><p>The horse did not say anything on stage and appeared there only as the nightmare to scare an idler in his sleep and make him start to study better. We performed in the school gym, and in the Regiment Club, and even went on a tour out of Zone – to the club of Pistovo village. Everywhere, the appearance of the horse sparked vivacity among the audience…
</p><p>Besides the movies at the Regiment Club, I sometimes went to the House of Officers, asking   the ticket money from my parents. It was there that I watched the French adaptation of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> for the first time.
</p><p>Before the show, bad rumors circulated the thick crowd gathered in the vestibule hall, they murmured that the film had not been brought and they would show some other flicks instead, so that not to return money for the sold tickets.
</p><p>On the wall of the vestibule there hung a huge portrait of Marshal Malinovsky with all his orders and medals on. The collection was really enormous leaving no vacant spot on his tunic screened with all kinds of medals and orders, like an over-all coat of mail, with smaller medals hanging even below his waist.
</p><p>Looking at the chain-mailed marshal, I thought that I wouldn’t watch anything else  even if they did not give  the  money back.
 But the alarm turned out to be false and the happiness, spiced with the sound of ringing swords, lasted the whole two sequels, and in color too!.
</p><p>The exploration of the Detachment’s Library was marked by new achievements. Not only that I had long ceased to be afraid of the pictures in the wide hallway, but I also became a seasoned shelf-hanger.
</p><p>As the shelving of books crowded quite close to each other, I got the hang of climbing right up to the ceiling for which purpose the shelves both sides of the narrow passages became, like, convenient ladder-rungs.
 I wouldn’t say that on the previously unreachable shelves there were some special books, not at all, however, the acquired skills of mountaineering increased my self-esteem like after that occasion when Natasha called me from my sofa-readings because there was an owl in the basement of the corner building.
</p><p>Of course, I immediately ran after her. The basement corridor was illuminated by a single bulb that somehow managed to survive the harsh times of the crook wars. At the end of the corridor under the opening to the outside pit, there sat a large bird on the floor, much bigger than an owl. Some real eagle owl it was who angrily shook his eared head with the crooked nose, no wonder that the kids did not dare approach.
</p><p>My reaction was surprisingly deft, without a moment’s hesitation, as if handling maverick eagle owls was my daily routine, I took my shirt off and threw it over the bird’s head. Then, grabbing at the clawed legs, I lifted the bird from the floor. The owl didn’t resist under the cover of my tartan shirt.
 Where to now? Of course, I took it home, especially since I was not fully clad.
</p><p>Mom didn’t agree to keep such a big monster at home although our neighbors, the Savkins, had a hefty crow in their apartment. Mom answered that Grandmother Savkin’s main job was wiping up the crow guano all over their apartment all day long, and who would do it in ours with all of us at work and school?
</p><p>Reluctantly, I promised to take the eagle owl to Living Nature Room at school next morning  because there already lived a squirrel and a hedgehog in their cages. Till then, he was allowed to sit in the bathroom.
</p><p>For the eagle owl’s refreshment, I took a slice of bread to the bathroom and a saucer full of milk. He gravely sat in the corner and did not even look at the food on the floor tiles. Going out, I turned the light off, in the hope that, being a night predator, he’d find it even in the dark.
</p><p>First thing in the morning, I checked and saw that the eagle owl hadn’t pecked a crumble of his supper. He also partook none of it while I had breakfast though the light  in the bathroom  was left on for the purpose. So, I clutched his bare legs and carried him to school.
</p><p>Probably, owls do not like hanging upside down because that eagle owl constantly tried to bend his head up as far as his neck let it go. At times, I gave my schoolbag to my brother and carried the bird with both hands in the normal position.
</p><p>When from the hillock top opened the distant view of the school, the owl’s head dropped and I realized that he was dead. I felt even relieved that he wouldn’t have to live in the captivity of the smelly Living Nature Room.
</p><p>Veering from the path, I hid him in a shrub because once I saw a hawk hanged from a thick bough of the old tree atop the Bugorok-Knoll. I didn’t want them to feather or somehow mutilate my owl, even though dead as he was…
</p><p>Later, Mom said that the bird died, probably, of old age that’s why he sought refuge in the basement.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…but I think all that happened so that we would meet each other. He was a messenger to me, it's only that I haven’t understood the message yet... Birds are not just birds and ancient augurs knew that well…
</p><p>My house in Stepanakert is located on the slope of a deep ravine behind the Maternity Hospital. It’s the last house in a dead-end, a very quiet place indeed.
</p><p>Once, coming home, I saw a small bird, the size of a sparrow, in the withered late-autumn grass by the footpath.  In fumbling unsteady steps, it trailed through the brittle grass as if severely wounded, dragging the wings in its wake.
</p><p>I gave it a passing look and went on, burdened with too many problems of my own...
 The next day I learned that right about that moment a young man was butchered a little deeper in the ravine in a brawl of junkie bros.
</p><p>That small bird was the soul of the murdered and there’s no chance of making me change this my belief…) </p>
