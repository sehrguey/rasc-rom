<img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
<p>
Instead of a volume of short stories by W. M. Maugham in Ukrainian (a single copy from 150 000 published) a weighty parcel firmly sat down on my shelves, dead as a doornail.
My part in the planned project was executed on all the points, which stripped my further living on of any goal whatsoever.
Life still rolled along the rutted track, yet aimlessly already and unplanned.
However, if you don't ask the useless question "what for?", then a Thursday with the bathhouse, and the steam room, and the subsequent two bottles of beer would suffice to motivate living for another week. Admire monks of the Tibet, who rough it up there even deprived of the mentioned stimulants.
</p><p>In my, not quite Tibetan, yet well-structured way of life there  felt an undeniable lack of carnal pleasures.
I caught myself thinking this thought on the evening when, coming after work to Decemberists 13, I cast the usual glance at the mingle-mangle crowd of shoes and slippers about the shoe shelf on the veranda.
The in-depth self-investigation that followed the hot trail of the glance, made it clear that my eyes were trying to make out the high-wedge Austrian high boots there.
Of course, it was not the eyes' fault that made in Austria footwear was so durable and unwilling to wear out from my memory. Yet, what high boots might possibly come to the veranda in summer? And for what reason would she ever come to Konotop, let alone  Decemberists 13?.
Such rhetorical questions helped to make me a laughing stock before myself, but could not prevent nightly ejaculations…
</p><p>In the dead of night, my sleep was interrupted because I threw my head up and dropped it sharply onto the wooden armrest above my pillow in the folding coach-bed.
However, the pain and blood from the broken eyebrow did not obscure the fact of soaked underpants. I took them off, used to wipe my loins, and threw behind the other armrest by the wallpapered wall, they could sit there till the morning.
Then I got up, made a couple of steps through the darkness, switched  the lamp on the table on and, returning to the folding coach-bed, yanked off the blanket. Hell!
A dark damp spot blotted the landscape of the crimson tablecloth, which since long had lost its fringe and become the folding coach-bed’s cover.
</p><p>"That's right," said I to myself. "That's exactly what you stole it for."
Then I pulled and folded some part of the soaked cover to prevent body contact with the jism, and lay back down to sleep the night through.
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"They are simply white spots<br>
Those cryptic black holes...<br>
...lure the quest to lose way in tornado-like whirlings...<br>
...with the black semen splotches in the white of bedsheet..."
</p><p>And also using public transportation means in rush hours at times turned a real trial.
I did not mind being squeezed from all sides by passengers  packed tightly in the streetcar to shape you into a concave quarry pip of the Ace of Diamonds, as long as they don’t press you against the rondure of a young female ass, which is grossly unfair.
Damn! The situation fires up a breaker-like boner on your part, which fact can’t be concealed by the raincoats on both of you.
Yet, with no room to step back in the crowd of passengers squeezed in like two barrels of herring into one, all you can do is just to stand on with a despondent stare out the window of the streetcar on its swift run, like, I have nothing to do with that thing. But if not yours, then whose?
</p><p class="centered2 bold  ital">"Blessed be the curves and bends<br>
And other twists of tramway tracks,<br>
The accomplices of the sweetest touches,<br>
Quite decent, almost accidental..."
</p><p>It's hard to list all sorts of things exposing sexual starvation, shortened by the scientifically bent folks  to the term "libido".
And they highly recommend the application of that damned Libido medicine for those engaged in creative professions, like, to give a sharp rise to the engaging drive in your manufactures.
But what the f-f..er..I mean, frolic was I supposed to do with that f-f..er..funky Libido, being neither Van Gogh nor Walt Whitman?!.
And that f-f..er..well, feverish libido could seize me suddenly not only in the means of public transportation, or in erotic nightmares, but even at the workplace. Only that at work, the creative orgasm was reachable without physiological erection.
</p><p>For instance, during the finishing works at the 100-apartment block, an unfamiliar young plasterer seemed very attractive to me.
A passing glance was quite enough to see the rural beauty’s immunity to any intellectual pursuits, but the purity of the blush, the tempting outlines of her breasts and thighs (discernible even through the deforming <em>spetzovka</em>) disarmed and captivated me so that I decided to gush up Song of Songs of my own, using the plasterer as a model...
</p><p>Normally, the plastering works are started at a construction site after covering the floor slabs with the layer of expanded clay. Expanded clay is a good thermal insulation material, but it crunches underfoot until it is covered with the screed at the subsequent stages of finishing works.
</p><p>Turning a couple of times to my cautious steps over the expanded clay—I neared the doorway to make the details of the supposed masterpiece more precise—the model asked Trepetilikha, who was plastering a jamb in the same room, "Could that bozo stole my trowel?"
</p><p>"Not a chance," replied Trepetilikha. "This one if even stumbles on your trowel would never pilfer it."
</p><p>Given the dimensions of my libido at that period, the new Song of Songs would have easily surpassed the Solomon's creation, and only the cynic suspicion of my involvement in the theft saved the world literature from the upcoming reassessment of all its values.
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"From the highest cliff<br>
Over the sea, blue and boundless,<br>
Off I dumped my libido<br>
To get rid of it<br>
Yet... O, my!.<br>
All of the wast blue sea<br>
Drowned in my bluesy libido.<br>
Oops!."
</p><p>Hell!.
Two divorces and three stretches in the Romny madhouse leave you with a damn slim prospect of developing a stable relationship, or any at all for that matter.
</p><p>But you cannot lace up a blizzard...
Good news, it's not whipping my face, but pushing from behind towards the station in the early morning twilight.
Dense streams of snow in the squally wind push the twilight back towards the darkness.
</p><p>Knee-deep in snowdrifts I flounder on by the supposed service path alongside the railway track.
The concrete pillars holding the contact wire above the rails serve the milestones not to get lost in the  desert of floating snow.
It's better not to look back – the stream of blinding snow instantly sticks like a chilly mask all over the face. Besides, there's nothing behind to look for – it has been and is gone.
</p><p>But  why do I see her naked body as white as the  churning white foam of this frenzied blizzard?
And she's not alone – having a sex with someone. Not me…
</p><p>I turn my face back to the snowy slaps, to wake up, not see.
In my brain, I switch on the splashes of the organ from the House of Organ Music, they are tattered, piercing and not precise, but distract...
</p><p>... I must be a pervert indeed... no normal one would have a hardon watching his wife fucking somebody else  midst this snowstorm...
</p><p>...what wife? You don't have no wife!.
</p><p>...okay, not wife, the love of the lifetime then...
</p><p>...shut up, asshole!.
</p><p>I shook my head in desperation and, with a groan, wandered on. A hard glancing hit from behind at my left shoulder called to order.
The local train from Nezhin was making  through the blizzard for the station.
</p><p>...the trains are always right, they don't have deviations...
</p><p>...look, the blurred lights ahead, above the fourth platform...
</p><p>...from there in the common throng to the station square to our Seagull...
</p><p>...everything is okay, I'm just like everyone else…</p>
