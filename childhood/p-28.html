<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The firewood got to the basement in early autumn. A slow-go truck would enter the Courtyard and dump a heap of ruffly halved bole chunks nearby the tin-clad lid of the cemented pit right in the center of every sidewall of the Block's houses. Inside one-and-a-half meter deep pit, slightly up from its bottom, there started a hole through the foundation, 50 cm x 50 cm, which ended in the basement dark corridor at about a meter-and-half above its cemented floor. The chunks were dropped down into the pit, and thence, through the hole,  into the basement to be hauled into the section whose owner the firewood was brought for.
</p><p>As I was already a big boy, Dad instructed me to throw the wood pieces into the pit so that he could drag them through the hole down into the basement. Dropping them in, I could not see him, but heard his voice from down there when he shouted me to stop if the pile of chunks in the pit threatened to block the hole. Then I waited until there came muffled thuds of the pieces toppling onto the cemented floor in the basement corridor.
</p><p>Everything went quite well before Natasha told Sasha that they had brought the firewood for us and I was helping Dad to move the wood down there. Sasha came running to the heap of log chunks and started dragging them and dropping into the pit. To all my furious clarifications that he was violating the age limits for such a work, and that the very next chunk he dropped would surely block the hole, he answered with silent but obstinate snuffling and just went on.
</p><div id= "span"><p>(…any rhetoric is lost on those whose Stubbornness-Mommy was born a moment before them!. )
</p></div><p>Yet, I not only made speeches but also kept throwing the wood, so that later, at midday meal in the kitchen, Sasha would not make hints that he did more than me. And suddenly he tottered back from the pit, his hand clutching his face with the blood-smeared fingers. Natasha rushed home to call Mom, who came running with a damp cloth to wipe the blood off Sasha’s upturned face.
</p><p>Dad also raced from the basement and no one was listening to my defense that all that happened accidentally, not on purpose, when the piece of wood thrown by me scratched the skin on my brother’s nose. Mom yelled at Dad because he allowed all that to happen. Dad also grew angry and told everyone to go home, and he'd finish the work himself.
</p><p>The scratch healed very soon, although Sasha stubbornly peeled the patch off his nose even before the midday meal.
</p><div id= "span"><p>(…I doubt if my brother would recollect the happening, it’s only me who remembers and feels guilty: yes, it was not deliberate, but instead of futile orations I should have been more watchful tossing them chunks…)
</p></div>
<p>At school, I regularly enrolled in this or that Group, whenever its tutor entered our classroom to recruit volunteers. Group meetings were held in the late afternoon so that participants had time to go home, have their midday meal, and come back to school. After a one-hour session of learning and training at the Group, its members returned home through the complete night darkness...
</p><p>One evening after the Group activities were over, a bunch of participants dropped into the school gym where there was an upright piano on the stage behind the closed curtain, and where one boy once showed me that if you hit only the black keys then it sounded like Chinese music. But that evening I forgot all about the music because besides the piano on the stage, there were several boys from senior grades who had a pair of real boxing gloves!
</p><p>We dared to ask permission to touch the gloves’ shiny leather and try them on. The senior graders kindly allowed us that, and then they had an idea of holding a match between the sprats, a fighter from the Gorka (that is someone from the blocks atop the hill) against someone of lowlanders who dwelt in the rows of wooden houses at the foot of the Gorka hill.
</p><p>The choice fell on me—O! and I wanted it so dearly!—and so did red-haired fatty Vovka from among the lowlanders. As the stage was illuminated too poorly for the match, all the present went over to the gym hallway under the bright bulb reflected in the ink-black winter darkness behind the wide window-pane, and they commanded “box!” to me and Vovka.
</p><p>At first, we both chuckled punching each other with the bulky balls of gloves, but soon we grew hot and angry. I in earnest wanted to deal a good one in his head while in his eyes in that very head you unmistakably could read his craving to knock me down. Before long my left shoulder, which kept receiving all his blows, felt terribly sore, while my right hand, that kept hitting his shoulder, grew limp and floppy.
</p><p>Probably, his state was no better, our giggles turned into puffing and gasping. It was bad and unbearably painful because his blows, like, penetrated to the very bone of my forearm, but I would rather die than surrender. At last, the big boys got bored with such a monotony, they told us “enough!” and took away their gloves.
</p><p>The next morning a purple-black bruise decorated my left forearm and for several following days I was very touchy at that spot, ducking even from a friendly pat and issuing the hiss of self-defending gander…
</p><p>If the Courtyard was covered with powder snow but not too deep, all of our family went out to clean the carpet and the runner. We spread them face down on the snow and stomped on their backs. Then the carpet was turned over, the snow from the snowdrifts about it got swept with a broom onto all of the carpet’s face and then swept away. Done. And we folded the carpet.
</p><p>The long green runner remained face down after the stomping, and the four of us—Mom and the three children—gathered upon it, and Dad dragged the runner over the snowdrifts with all of us standing upon its back, leaving a crumpled, dust-smeared, furrow through the snow in our wake. Yes, our Dad was so strong and mighty!
</p><p>And making use of a slushy snowfall, the boys began to roll the snow in the Courtyard to form huge balls and build a fortress. For a start, you made a regular snowball, put it down onto a snowdrift, and began rolling it back and forth. The lump immediately swelled with layers of slush snow stuck all over it. The snowball turned bigger than a football, then grew above your knees, becoming denser, heavier and you had to call for help already and, in a team of two or three, roll it to the fortress building site where the big boys hoisted it and fixed into the course of dense snow lumps making the circular wall taller than you…
</p><p>We divided into two parties – the fortress defenders and the assaulting troops. In a record short time, the snowball-ammo was hurriedly produced and – off to the storm they rushed!
</p><p>Shrieks, yells, babel; snowballs swishing from all the sides and in every direction. I stuck my head out above the fortress wall choosing a boy to hit with my snowball but a crack of yellow lightning flashed in my eyes, like an exploding electric bulb. With my back sliding against the wall, down I crouched, my hands firmly pressed to the eye whipped with a snowball.
</p><div id="span"><p>(<em><strong> " oh, I forgot, they killed me in the charge…”</strong></em> so depicted such a moment Nikolai Gumilyov in his poem…)
</p></div><p>Yet, the battle raged on, and no one cared about bodies of the fallen buddies. Everything fused and drown in one united warcry, “A-a-a-a-a-ah!” After a period out of any time the battle was over. The fortress never surrendered but turned into a hillock of snow trampled firm and hard as ice. Yet, the roaring did not stop, with the same unquenchable yell we kept sliding down the hillock on our bellies, the heads turned kinda hollow and filled with a sort of dull deafness because of your and others’ crazy, unceasing, howl, “A-a-a-a-a-ah!”
</p><p>My eye could see already. I slapped up a snowball and hit the head of a boy older than me. What a mistake!
 Firstly, the battle was long since ended and that boy had  already come with his skates on.
</p><p>How could I be so reckless? As always, because of trying to keep things in proper order, to make everything right.
</p><p>Ages before, at the start of fortress construction, the eldest boys—seventh-and-eighth-graders—announced, “who does not build will not play”, and I knew for sure that the boy in skates was not among the builders.
 But who now cared about the right things and justice? Many of the founder boys had left already. The remainder had completely forgotten the pre-battle declaration.
</p><p>Yet, there was no time to present justifications for so cheeky a deed, and there was no one to listen or help out, so – run for your life!
</p><p>And I plunged headlong towards the staircase-entrance door of our house. Maybe he wouldn’t catch up with his skates on in the trampled snow drifts?
</p><p>Running, exhausted with many hours of the wild game, I was still running. The entrance door’s already so close! “But if he’ll still catch up?” flashed in my mind, and I got a skate kick in the ass for such an inappropriate fear. Slamming the door I flew through the vestibule where he dared not follow – it’s someone else’s house…
</p><div id="span"><p>(…if you want everything to work out as it should, you mustn’t doubt that so it would…)
</p></div><p>In the spring that followed, my parents tried their hand at farming. That is, they decided to plant potatoes... When with a spade and a bagful of potatoes they started for the forest after work, I begged to take me too.
</p><p>We came to the endless narrow clearing in the forest, the former border of Zona before the expansion of the Object’s area. Dad made holes in the soil that he turned the day before, and Mom dropped potatoes into them. Their faces   looked sad and Dad wistfully shook his head and asserted that the soil was not of the right sort of soil, but merely loam on which nothing could possibly grow.
</p><p>Soon, the quiet spring twilight thickened, and we started home.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…a little anticipatory, I’ll say that the attempted kitchen garden indeed yielded nothing. Was the failure because of the loam, or the doubt annulled any possibility of success?.
</p><p>And, what is really inconceivable, why did they start it at all? To save costs for potatoes? But we were not so poor then.
</p><p>In the parents’ room there appeared a fold-out couch-bed, two armchairs with lacquered armrests of wood, and a three-legged coffee table, all of them making one furniture set.
</p><p>Probably, they simply wanted to take a break from all that furniture and the farming enterprise served an excuse for fleeing to the forest…)</p></div>
