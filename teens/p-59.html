 <br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>To Leningrad, we went through Moscow.  Besides me and Lyudmila Konstantinovna, School 13 was represented in the excursion group by two more girls from my class – Tanya and Larissa, as well as by two students from the parallel, 7 “A” grade – Vera Litvinova, and Tolik Sudak, the rest of the group were students from other city schools with a couple of their teachers.
 </p><p>The train arrived in Moscow in the morning, and we spent there one day during which time I came across three discoveries.
 The first of them became the discovery of the undeniable existence of foreshadowing dreams. It happened during our tour on an excursion bus around the city—look to the left! look to the right!—until at some place, we were asked to leave the bus and look at something from a near.
</p><p>Our group followed the guide closely but I straggled at some distance, when, all of a sudden, the surroundings looked so much familiar to me – both that bridge above no river, and the far-off tower of the Moscow State University, and even the locked stall on the pavement I walked by.
</p><p>Someone from our group turned back and called me, “Don’t lag or we will leave without you!”, to which I answered, “When you turn back, I’ll be the first!”
 </p><p>And exactly that moment I felt having already seen that view in all its details and pronounced those very words because all of that was in a dream dreamed by me a week before.
 I felt freaked out and even stopped, but not for long – the excursion group was indeed returning to the bus.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…in my subsequent life, time and again I had the like instances of getting back to once-seen dreams.
</p><p>Some of such dream recollections could for a split-second precede the actual development of the happening being lived in real so that I knew who and what would say a second later, and with what gesture they would accentuate their words because the going on scene was just an echo of what had been already seen by me in some earlier dream.
</p><p>Duration of such presaging dreams is not exceedingly long, and at times it can take years before their echoing in my wake hours.
</p><p>I never discussed my discovery with anyone and much later, with a mixture of relief and disappointment, I learned that such things happen not only to me, and that folks in Scotland even have a special term for the phenomenon – “second sight”…)
</p></div><p>After the second revelation, we went to the All-Union Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy, aka Veh-Deh-eN-Kha.
</p><p>There we were taken to the Astronautics Pavilion, with the gigantic white needle of “Vostok”  spaceship put in front of its facade, one from the series by which Gagarin orbited the Earth.
 Inside the spacious pavilion, several excursions were wandering at once among the stands, and mock-ups and mannequins donned in red spacesuits and bulky helmets.
</p><p>I did not know what the other guides were sharing to their groups, but ours ruminated things known by anyone from the times immemorial, so I kept lagging, or running ahead, and at some point sneaked off into a wide side door.
 </p><p>Stone steps led upward following the arrowed inscription “The Optics Pavilion”.
 I reached the landing where the steps U-turned going up to the pavilion itself. But I didn’t follow them any farther immobilized and fascinated by the extravaganza of colorful airiness unfolded on the landing.
</p><p>A whopping  cube of space was filled with a motionless, as if frozen, family of soap bubbles of all sizes radiating silently diverse hues of the rainbow colors. What a delight!.
</p><p>Someone from our group had noted my deviation from the programmed rout and I was called from down there, “Come back! We're leaving!”
 With a parting look to the unreached pavilion entrance on the upper landing, I joined the group of our excursion.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…what was behind that door I do not know and the discovery itself is as follows: sometimes a single step away from the trodden rut opens new shining worlds, but, as runs a popular folk adage in the country that was the first to undertake creation of a Socialist society, “A step aside is classified as an attempt at fleeing, they’ll shoot to kill without warning”…)
</p></div><p>The final, third, discovery of that day was lurking in the State Universal Shop, aka GUM, on the Red Square, where we arrived without any guide already.
 There, I learned that dreams do come true, you only need to be ready for their realization…
</p><p>At the entrance to GUM, we were told to gather in the same spot after a half-hour and were dismissed for random search for goods.
  From inside, GUM looked like a giant ocean liner with ample wells of space enclosed by multi-story transitions up the hull sides.
</p><p>In one of the compartments on the third floor, they were selling the billiards of my dream whose price was exactly ten rubles. O, how I did curse my gluttony!
 </p><p>From the sum given by Mother, I had already paid for two ice-cream – one in the morning at the station, and the other at the Veh-Deh-eN-KHa. There remained nothing I could do but say goodbye to my dream so, to mitigate the grief, I ate one more ice-cream right in the GUM.
 </p><p>In the evening tired but wholly satisfied (if counting out the misfire about the billiards) we left Moscow for Leningrad…
 </p><p>In the city on the Neva river, we were billeted in a school on Vasilevsky Island, not far from the Zoo.
 At the school, we were allotted half of the gym, since the other half was occupied already by an excursion group from the Poltava city.
 We did not cause  them any inconvenience—the gym was pretty spacious—and only moved several black sports mats they were not using into another corner.
 Additionally to the mats, we were given cloth blankets getting accommodated for sleep with much more comfort than the royal court of France, when fled from the rioting Paris in <em>Twenty Years Later</em> by Alexandre Dumas where poor aristocrats were provided for the purpose with just raw straw and no linen…
</p><p>For three meals a day, we walked up a couple of blocks to a canteen next to a humpbacked bridge above the Moika river. A very quiet place it was, with hardly any traffic at all.
 There, our heads paid in advance with paper coupons and the girls from the excursion group laid the food on the square tables before inviting the rest of us to come in from the sidewalk. Sometimes we had to wait because apart from the Poltava’s and ours there were other groups as well – not from our gym though.
  In such a case we stood waiting on the nearby bridge over the narrow river with its unobservable flow between the upright stone-walled banks.
</p><p class="ital bold centered2">“On the Moika bank,<br>
 we ate garbage skank”
 </p><p>So ran the epigram composed by someone from our group.
 </p><div id="span"><p>(…the rhyme, of course, is flawless, but I personally had no complaints about the food there – everything was as it always was in any canteen I dropped in along my life path…)
 </p></div><p>We were a little late for the white nights but everything else was in place – both Nevsky Avenue, and the Palace Bridge, and trotting through the halls of the Hermitage with the immense Pompei demolition by Karl Bryullov, and luxurious, yet small, oil paintings by Dutch masters…
 </p><p>In St. Isaac Cathedral they launched for us the Foucault’s Pendulum hanging all the way down from the main dome.
 It swung for some time swishing between the disgruntled, icon decorated, walls and then pegged down one of the sizable wooden pins lined on the polished floor.
</p><p>“See?!”  exclaimed the enthusiastic  Cathedral guide.”The Earth is turning, after all. Foucault’s Pendulum has just proved this scientifically.”
</p><p>The revolutionary battleship Aurora denied us admittance for some reason, but we listened to the Admiralty’s Cannon fired each day to mark the noon, and visited The Piskaryovskoye Cemetery with green lawns over the  mass graves of people starved in the years of fascist Blockade and the pool by the dark wall for the visitors to drop their coins in.
 </p><p>The day when we went to Peterhof was cloudy, and crossing the Finnish Gulf we could not see the sea but only  fog above the circle of yellowish water with low waves around the boat, like on a lake with a sandy bottom.
 It was boring and dank, and when I got out of the passenger hall and climbed down the short ladder to the low stern with  churned up foam behind it, the boat boy came up to tell that passengers were not allowed there.
  I climbed back, and he hung a chain on the ladder and started to wash the deck of the stern with a mop.
</p><p>But the Peterhof fountains jetted pillars of surprisingly white water below the hillock with the palace closed for restoration…</p>
