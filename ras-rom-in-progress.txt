Foreword, a sort of 
  
Apologies & Excuses 
Being completely clean of fancy flights of fantasy, aggravated by all thumbs at spinning yarn, left me no choice but telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth; in other words, no merry sallies from within the straitjacket of my personal experience. Which, muchly rueful, limitations annul any ambition to keep abreast with the hackney horses of literary production turning out whales of whimsy lucubrations wrought in line with the bestselling practices at the fantasy, science, mystery, thriller, action, each and every, you name it, twist of fiction in the field. Some sprightly jades indeed! 
But—poor, yet proud—I hereby declare that not anything at all would fit under your skin real nice and smoothly, neither would you in a breeze pull off a fickle fancy whatsoever, like, walking through the walls and over the waters or, say,  indulging in unhealthy recreational addiction to sucking strangers’ blood in totally unsanitary environs. (A sigh.) 
Structure & Content 
Starting with its lengthy title, the novel goes past this here foreword, sort of, and through the following epigraph—curt, but to the point—flows into the narration not marked by overly excessive terseness, four books all in all, with certain passages well nigh sufficient to efface the credence to my solemn oath in the above subsection being taken in good faith. 
Not every truth gets a warmhearted welcome, no one is guaranteed from someone else tossing their back up to emphasize a torrid protest, “Bullshit! Don't dream of selling me that!” 
My meek, immediate, amicable, advise to deeply disbelieving skeptics is to put The Rascally Romance off until they, hopefully, obtain a clearer vision that even truth now and then comprise surprises on a par with any of the weirdest phantasms. And if the truth of this observation rests dim for some obtuse dork, then, “I do envy you, O, truly blessed one!.” is all there is to say.
Though a first-person story, The Rascally Romance, nonetheless, is not a self-relishing report about me, myself and the Number One, yet a portrayal of the whole generation from the most breathtaking, unequaled, and fascinating era since the world creation. 
Now, with comprehending bitterness, I witness the glorious period cinched tightly with a couple of labels, crisscross—«stagnation»><«restructuring»—packed and sealed, all readied to be dumped into the bottomless bin of the past. Yet, neither smart labeling nor shifty package tricks would ever eliminate the fact that the entire history of mankind owns no period to match the one when so young we were. 
Style & Language & Age Restrictions 
It goes without saying that each and every generation inevitably enjoys or lives through their own youth, yet some of them miss out to erect an epistolary pillar marking the fact appropriately. 
The style abided by the erection at hand can be baptized as rabid realism, to wit, this particular ball is ruled by Mrs. Naked Truth handing soft soap out to neither written nor tacit laws. 
Moving from the style to the language used in The Rascally Romance, it should be noted that the grim-mouthed pearl-clutching language purists might disapprove of presence in the body text some common taboo words. I fully grasp their venerable point and would willingly pull along with the sentiment but for the fear to look a petty diddler. In a true-to-life presentation, you just cannot hold back them those words because life, as it is, would differ from a family movie. For that reason, I expressly discourage any person under 18 years of age to read on any further. 
I am serious: DROP IT RIGHT AWAY, KID! Before it’s too late... 
Technical Notes & Self-Appraisal 
Letters are not supposed to be divided into chapters or parts; they just flow on and on and on, to their end. However, to leave a reader without any map or compass surrounded by hundreds upon hundreds of pages in each direction, to deprive them of any guiding star or two, calls for an exceptionally brazen brutality. 
A caring compassion for humanoid brethren and sistern stirred me up to adding The Table of Contents. 
Ain’t I a fucking philanthropist thereafter?. 
Acknowledgments & Disclaimer 
I thank you all, whose names appear in the tale, as well as those who are not in there (you are indefinitely more in numbers and your contribution to this here work having been written after all is equally important). 
And no less essential was your reading along at least up to this very line. Any book can only be produced by a collaborative team of two: the reader and the author. Thank you because I am (dead serious and no kidding) hugely honored by your most kind cooperation. 
And now we’ve just reached the point when everyone has to decide for themselves whether to return to their pursuit of customary business and/or pleasures, to all those pet joys, and daily problems alongside with habitual rewards and outlets befitting people of sober good sort which (between the two of us, as one buddy-teammate to the other) might be the most reasonable course because you never can tell what insidious vortexes and currents might lurk out there or else keep rowing on ahead, past and beyond the popping buoy of this foreword, a sort of... 
Whoa! After a rambling passage of this kind I do have to shut up and take a breather, meanwhile, feel free to use the stretch for making your informed decision... 
Sincerely, it doesn’t matter what you choose, just don’t hurry at making up your mind and stay assured whatever the outcome there’s no way to put the blame on me because of the disclaimer in conclusion – 
regardless of which course you pick, you’ll never be the same hereafter.

epigraph:
Looks like that’s it,
As of yet,
And even if not quite,
Still, sort of, may be,
Because of else,
”Hey, you!.“
Bang and – a-ha!.
