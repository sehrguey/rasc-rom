 <br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>
 <p>That morning the gambling bouts at <em>Bitok</em> ran low behind the gym.
 </p><p>On that clear April morning, the lads stood arguing and waiting for the confirmation of the welcome rumors that the Central TV news program “Time” made a gross mistake last night. Because some guy heard from guys from School 10 that last night some man landed with a parachute in the Sarnavsky forest by the Konotop outskirts. And now from the City center would arrive Sasha Rodionenko, whose family had recently moved over there, but he still attended our school, just let's wait him come, he should know for sure, he would confirm…
 </p><p>I remembered the flight of Gagarin and as soon after him Guerman Titov was orbiting all day long to say in the evening, “Bye, for now, I’m going to bed.” And Dad chuckled with delight and replied to the radio on the wall, “That’s a good one!”
 </p><p>Our cosmonauts were always the first and we, elementary school pupils, were arguing who of us was the first to hear the radio announcement about the flight of Popovich or Nikolayev, or the first cosmonautess Tereshkova…
 </p><p>Sasha Rodionenko came but he didn’t confirm anything. So the Central TV news program “Time” was not mistaken. And the sun faded in grief.
 </p><p>Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov…In the landing module…
 </p><p>Entering the dense layers of the earth’s atmosphere…
 </p><p>Perished…
 </p><p>Then Father came and was  a week later followed by the railway container with our things from the Object that arrived at the Freight station and moved from there on a platform truck to 19 Nezhin Street, both the wardrobe with the mirror on its door and the folding couch-bed, and the two armchairs with wooden armrests, and the TV set, and all the other implements and things. Even the old-fashioned leatherette sofa arrived for which there was no room in the <em>khutta</em>.
 </p><div id="span"><p>(…now I cannot but feel horrified: how was it possible for ten people – two families and the mutual Grandma Katya – to fit in and live on in one room and a kitchen?
 </p><p>But at that time I didn’t think of such things at all because since it was our home and we lived there the way we lived, then it couldn’t be somehow different, everything was as it should be and I just lived on along and that’s it..)
 </p></div><p>For the night, Sasha and I readied the folding couch-bed and shared it with Natasha, who lay across at out feet with a chair put next to the couch for her legs.
 </p><p>My brother and I had to keep our feet pulled up to the middle of our bed, otherwise, Natasha would  grumble and complain  to the parents on their bed at the opposite wall, and tell on me and Sasha for kick-fighting.
 </p><p>Nice news! She could stretch her legs out as far as she wanted, and rebuffed my offers to swap our places…
 The family of Arkhipenkos and Grandma Katya slept in the kitchen.
</p><p>Parallel to Nezhin Street, about three hundred meters off, there ran Professions Street one side of which was just one endless wall of tall concrete slabs fencing the Konotop Steam-Engine and Railroad-Car Repair Plant, which name was commonly eschewed and substituted with the short and nice KaPeVeRrZe.
 </p><p>Because of that plant, the part of Konotop outside the Under-Overpass was named the KaPeVeRrZe Settlement, or just the Settlement.
 </p><p>On the Plant’s opposite side, the same slab-wall separated it from the multitude of railway tracks in the Konotop Passenger Station and the adjacent Freight Station, where long freight trains were waiting for their turn to start off to their different destinations because Konotop was a big railway junction.
 </p><p>The marshaling yard of the Freight Station with freight cars running down the hump, as loners or in small groups into the sorting lines, sent forth the shrieking screech of wheel chocks, bangs of cars against each other, indistinct screams of loudspeakers with reports about that or another train on that or another sorting line.
 </p><p>However, in the daytime the marshaling yard symphony was not too overbearing, its racket whooped it up against the background of night quietude after the noises of daylife subsided…
 </p><p>Regardless of any time of day, whenever it breezed from the nearby village of Popovka, the distillery there permeated the air with its unmistakable stink, which atmospheric phenomenon the Settlement folks christened “Popovka’s salutation”. Not that the reek was totally lethal, yet you were better off if shunned to sniff at it attentively, anyway, to have a running nose on such days was kinda blessing…
 </p><p>Nezhin Street connected to Professions Street by lots of frequent lanes.
  The first of those side streets (counting from School 13) was called Foundry Street because it led to where the former foundry was located inside the Plant and now not seen because of the concrete wall.
</p><p>Then there came Smithy Street offering the view of the tall brick smokestack by the  Plant’s smithy behind that same wall.
 </p><p>The next (past our house at number 19) was Gogol Street, ignoring the fact that there was no Gogol, or any other writer for that matter, in front or behind the Plant wall.
 </p><p>The mentioned three streets were more or less straight but those following them before and after the Nezhin Store tangled in the warren of differently directed lanes which, in the end, also led to the Plant wall if you knew how to navigate them…
 </p><p>The Nezhin Store gained that name because it stood in Nezhin Street and it was the largest of all the three stores in the Settlement. The smaller ones were named by their numbers.
 </p><p>The  premises of Nezhin Store occupied a separate one-story brick building and a backyard. It comprised four departments entered separately and marked by the time-worn tin frames over their doors: “Bread”, “Industrial Goods”, “Grocery”, and “Fish and Vegetables”.
 </p><p>The “Bread” opened in the morning to work until all of the “white” loaves and darker “brick” bread there was sold out and they could safely lock the emptied department. In the afternoon, with the arrival of the food truck with another bunch of “bricks” and loaves from the Konotop Bread Factory, it opened again.
 </p><p>The next, and also the spaciest, department—“Industrial Goods”—had two shop windows adorned with dust-smeared miniaturized boxes of security signalization pressed to their panes from inside, on both sides of its iron door. The showcase-counters with store-soiled goods were looked after by three bored saleswomen because they hardly saw a couple of customers a day. The Settlement population, when in need of such goods, preferred to travel to shops in the City center.
 </p><p>But the two saleswomen in the “Grocery” department had their hands full all day long. At times, there even formed a queue, especially on the days when the butter was brought to the department and they cut its huge yellow cube, put next to the scales, with their enormously big knife and wrapped your two or three hundred grams into the friable blue paper.
 </p><p>And when the “Grocery” was entered by a workman from the KaPeVeRrZe Plant, he was served without standing in the queue because in his palm there was a thoroughly counted and readied amount of kopecks for his vodka, which saved the trouble of counting the change. Besides, he was to come back to his workplace as soon as possible for which end he arrived without changing from his boiler suites, aka <em>spetzovka.</em>
 </p><p>The choice of vodkas in the department was fairly extensive, of different colors and names – “Zubrovka”, “Erofeich”, “ Let’s Have One More…” but people bought only “Moscow Vodka” with its green and white sticker.
 </p><p>The concluding “Fish and Vegetables” department was mostly locked not to disturb its empty dormant shelves and the dried-earth smell left by potatoes sold out last year…
 </p><p>And after the Nezhin Store, there were Locksmith Street, Wheels Street and in the unexplored as yet depths of the Settlement other streets and lanes and blind alleys…
 </p><p>The very first Sunday after our arrival, Aunt Lyuda led me and my brother and sister to Professions Street that was the only asphalted street in the Settlement. Following it in the direction of Bazaar, we reached the Plant Club for the three o’clock movie show for children.
 </p><p>The Plant Club was a mighty two-story building but as tall as a four-story one. The masonry of its walls and windows had lots of arches, ledges, and columns, like, a lace-work of smoky bricks. The concrete wall of the Plant enclosure did not miss to  surround the backside of the Club as well. In the small square in front of it, there was the Plant Main Check-Entrance built in the same ornate ante-revolution style of masonry, opposed with a modernist structure of the two-story murky-glass cube of the Plant Canteen.
 </p><p>We entered the lofty lobby of the Plant Club full of diverse-aged, yet equally noisy children lining to the small window in the tin-clad door of the ticket office. One boy, a second-grader by his looks, started leaching Aunt Lyuda for ten kopecks to buy himself a ticket, but she snapped at him and he shut up. She seemed to enjoy visiting the Plant Club for an afternoon show for children…
 </p><p>So I learned the route to the Club where, among other things, there also was the Plant Library of two huge halls.
 </p><p>The desks in the first one were loaded with layers of wide and thick newspapers’ filings. In the glazed doors of the tall cabinets lined by the walls, there stood familiar rows of never-asked-for works by Lenin, and Marx, and Engels and other similarly popular multi-volume collections.
 </p><p>The next hall had the stacks with normal books for reading. Needless to say, I enrolled immediately because the choice of books on the two shelves in our school library was niggardly poor…
 </p><p>On May Day, our school marched out for the demonstration in the city. The school column was decorated with the portraits on sticks in hands of the students (one portrait for three or four students carrying it in turn) displaying the current Members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
 </p><p>Headed by the group of teachers, we walked along the uneven cobbles in Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street to Bazaar where Professions Street shared its asphalt to Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street for its dive through the Under-Overpass.
 </p><p>The ascend from the tunnel on its opposite end met wide Peace Avenue stretching away to the tall railway embankment in the distance, after which it ran through the housing area of five-story buildings, named Zelenchuk, followed by the City center – Peace Square.
 </p><p>Peace Avenue, tangentially passing Peace Square, separated it from the City Council standing in the greens opposite to the granite-rimmed, never working, fountain in the middle of Peace Square concluded with the building of Peace Movie Theater.
 </p><p>The middle one of the three alleys in the greens that led directly to the City Council’s entrance porch was blocked with the red platform past which the whole city marched in the holiday demonstrations, except for the tenants of the five-story buildings bounding the square who watched demonstrations from their balconies. I envied them at first, but not for long…
 </p><p>On our way to Peace Square, the  column of School 13 had time and again to stop for long waits  letting  the schools of preceding numbers overtake us and go ahead. But the working organizations gave way to us, like the columns of the Locomotive Depot, or the Railway Distance Of the South-West Railroad, as it stood in white bulging letters cut of polystyrol and mounted on the crimson-velvet covering in the shields on wheels at their columns’ heads. No streetcars nor vehicles were seen along all of Peace Avenue, only people, lots of people on foot both walking in the wide stream of columns, and standing by, kinda live banks scanning the current, which made May Day so special and unlike other days.
 </p><p>On entering the vast Peace Square, we had to suddenly change our dignified marching step to a frivolous trotting and kinda run to attack, giggling and panting, with those portraits of Members atilt, to catch up with the previous column of which we, as usual, had fallen too far behind because of  bad timing.
 </p><p>And since School 13 was the last but one among the city school, by the moment we were passing the red platform, mixed up with School 14,  the loudspeakers shouted from up there, “The column of the Konotop Railway Technical School is entering Square! Hooray, comrades!”, making us  hooray to others and not to ourselves.
 </p><p>After Peace Square and past the entrance to the Central Park of Recreation, the road turned  right descending towards Lenin Street, but we didn’t go down there. In the nearest lane, we piled the Political Bureau Members and red banners on a truck that took them back to our school to sit in the Household Manager’s storeroom till the next demonstration.
 </p><p>And we also went back, on foot, giving Peace Square a pretty wide berth because the passages between the buildings bounding it were blocked with empty buses, face to face, and the vast of the empty square was strolled by solitary figures of leisurely pacing militiamen.
 </p><p>Yet, it still was a holiday, because before we started for the demonstration Mother gave each of us fifty kopecks, of which there even remained some change afterward for a bar of Plombir ice-cream in thin paper wrapping cost 18 kopecks and that of Creamy just only 13. The saleswomen in white robes sold ice-cream from their plywood double-walled boxes at every crossing along the trafficless Peace Avenue…
 </p><p>When I returned home, the schoolchildren in festive white shirts and red pioneer ties were still walking along Nezhin Street returning to the Settlement lanes after the demonstration.
 </p><p>And then I committed the first dastardly act in my life.
  I went out from the wicket of our <em>khatta </em>and wantonly shot with my crook pistol in the back of a passer-by boy. He chased me, but I ran back into the yard up to the kennel of Zhoolka who kept barking and yanking his chain violently, so the boy did not dare come up and only shouted his threats and abuses through the open wicket…</p>
