 <p>
But it was also Natasha who showed me a solution to the titanically insurmountable problem of turning the manuscripts into typewritten text.
She said there was a typing pool on the street connecting Square of Konotop Divisions and Sennoy Market and, maybe, someone there would agree to type those translations of mine...
</p><p>The two-story house of the typing pool looked like the “Cherevko's school”. From the entrance, a straight flight of wooden stairs led to the second floor where, in two adjacent rooms, a dozen of typists were with the amazing speed chirping their typewriters.
One of them, named Valya, with a bob-cut blond hair, agreed to type the shortest from the short stories, which I brought along in a thin copybook for a probe. She appointed a day for me to come after the finished text.
Taming my heartbeat, I said I had more translations. She replied I could bring them too, by one or two at a time.
I asked her about the payment, but she waved the question away...
</p><p>For a couple of months, I was visiting the typing pool on the days said by Valya.
I approached the house from the opposite sidewalk, in the best traditions of underground conspirators and secret agents. Diving in the wide-open door of the entrance, I cautiously sneaked to the second floor – just only not to shoo off the crazy luck...
Passing to Valya the copybook with the last of the stories, I again tried to find out about the payment, and she again dismissively shook her head.
</p><p>Labor must be rewarded, so I decided to pay anyway, if not with money, then in kind.
Near the streetcar stop by Peace Square, on the first floor of the five-story block, there stretched a row of shops, overhanging the sidewalk with their somewhat droopy shop windows.
The last in their row was "The Flowers" on the right, and the first, close to the square corner, "The Jewelry".
There, after several circles around the glass box-cabinets with exorbitantly expensive necklaces, bracelets, and gold rings, I bought a silver string for 25 rubles.
To fix it with a fitting case, I purchased a round lacquered powder box with an ornament for 5 rubles plus, however, that was from "The Souvenirs" section at the Department Store.
</p><p>Collecting the typewritten pages of the last story, I gave Valya the powder box and asked to look under the lid. She picked up from it a long thin string of white metal.
</p><p>"Melchior?" inquired the typist from the next desk.
I did not explain anything to anyone: whoever wanted would find a way to check what was of what...
That month, the alimony to Nezhin and Konotop again nosedived to 15 rubles each…
</p><p>A couple of days before May Day, I again felt like giving in to rituals.
From  Decemberists 13, I brought a piece of scarlet cloth, 40 cm × 40 cm, to the site in the locomotive depot. I nailed it to a two-meter beam from the pile of remnants of former trestles, and it turned a cheerful bunting.
So that it was not in the way with the work of our team, I fixed it upon the finished corner of the third-floor walls, and there it splashed happily in the spring wind, above the sun-gleaming river of railway tracks that streamed towards the station.
</p><p>Peter Kyrpa asked me if I was again for it, and I drove him a fool about the day of the international solidarity of working-class people.
He promised they would soon come to nab me again, but our team tacitly dismissed his prophecies.
Laying the courses of bricks in the wall, we sometimes looked back at the ripples in the flaunting red above our stooped working-class backs…
</p><p>On the morning of May Day, in my jeans and a T-shirt, I went out to the veranda to put my shoes on.
My parents also were there though for many years already they considered themselves not liable to partaking in them those demonstrations.
I sat down on a small stool made by golden hands of my father, to tie the strings on my black leather shoes.
</p><p>"You're not going anywhere," my mother said, and she moved to block the way to the glazed veranda door.
</p><p>"You'll stay home," confirmed my father, and bolted the same door with the steel latch produced by him at the RepBase.
The happening looked like a home arrest without trial and investigation.
Still sitting, I bowed my head and, in a low voice, began a plaintive air:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"Oh, Dnipro, Dnipro,<br>
you're a mighty stream,<br>
With the clouds afloat above you..."
</p><p>I did not know the following lyrics from that song, so I got up and took a step towards the door.
My father seized my neck with the grip of his working-class arms of a hammerer, diesel engine tamer, and skillful locksmith. I always admired the bass-relief bumps of his biceps.
My mother hung on my opposite shoulder.
</p><p>Dragging their total weight, I continued slow progress towards the door.
There, I pulled the latch aside, wriggled out from the suffocating grip of the two opponents, and jumped off the porch onto the brick-paved path to the wicket.
</p><p>"Buster!" shouted my father.
</p><p>"Scoundrel!" backed him up my mother.
</p><p>With a victorious sneer, I exclaimed, "Ca-up, Mom!"
</p><div id="span"><p>(...in our family tradition, at the age of two I pronounced "catch up!" that way...)
</p></div><p>Since then I stopped speaking to my parents, and I also dropped participating in the May and November demonstrations.
Instead, on reaching Professions Street, I turned left and walked to the very outskirts, where the <em>khuttas</em> were replaced with meadows bordered by trees of the forest belt along the railroad embankment.
From there, the deserted dirt road led me to the station of Kukolka.
</p><p>I did not go to the station though, but after a couple of kilometers followed the solitary track branching from the main railway.
It was never used by trains because of being a reserve track in case of war. Such a case would make Konotop a target for bombardment, as a strategically important junction, and the reserve track detoured the would-be-destroyed city...
Following that track over empty fields, I reached the forest by the Seim river.
</p><p>To the Seim itself, I went out not far from the local train stop "Pryseymovye", and walked to the place on its bank where once, still unmarried, I spent a day with Eera.
In that spot, I read an issue of<em> Morning Star</em>, almost completely, bypassing the last sports page, which I always ignored anyway. The newspaper was left in the grass on the bank, in case it might come handy for someone.
</p><p>The return journey was made along the main two-track embankment.
I entered Konotop together with it and for a long time continued walking along the adjacent gardens, right up to the second bridge, where the embankment turned to the railway station.
There we parted, and I went on, by the outskirts alongside the Swamp.
Already in the late evening darkness, I crossed Bogdan Khmelnitsky Street behind the old cemetery and, going up Sosnowska street, I reached the terminal of streetcar 3, from where to  Decemberists 13 there remained hop, skip and a jump.
</p><p>On the whole, it was like whirling in a wide vicious circle, with a return to the starting point after walking all day.
The music from the demonstrations loudspeakers was substituted with self-made marching chants, like:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"So what about<br>
are we laughing<br>
while our shoes<br>
this trail is roughing?"
</p><p>But all that was in the future, while for the very first time, I did not have<em> Morning Star</em>, instead of which there was a pinprick feeling in my chest on the left. And it did not want to disappear, no matter how often I scratched the T-shirt in that area.
</p><p>Even at night the annoyance persistently stayed by me, so in the morning I decided to have a session of labor therapy.
I went to the locomotive depot, penetrated its grounds deserted and submerged in quietude, because of the second holiday day, and went to the construction site of the administrative building.
</p><p>At the hillock of white silicate bricks dumpage, I planted an empty pallet and started stacking bricks on it. At times, it was necessary to press my chest with the left elbow, because the pin in there got replaced with a thick knitting needle.
When the standard twelve courses of bricks were stacked up on the pallet, I told myself that my case was not terminal, and climbed to the incomplete third floor.
There I took the Jolly Roger down from the corner wall, tore it from its mast, and slipped into a loop-hole in the slabs, and buried with dried mortar lumps and other debris…
</p><p>Kyrpa's threats remained just empty words, I was never taken to Romny that summer.
Might it be I had grown wiser? Very questionable indeed.
It's just because I had not run into a sore spot of some high-ranking bitch of a cadre...
By the middle of May, the needle, or pin, or whatever it was to pierce my chest, gradually dissolved, and many years later I realized that it was the first of heart attacks suffered by me…
</p><p>In my rough plan there cropped up another, but already pleasant, detail, that of assembling the typewritten pages into one complete volume of stories.
For that purpose, I bought a folder from the Department Store, with a hard plastic cover and nickel-plated rings inside. They usually use such folders for annual accounting reports lined up on the shelves in the accountancy office; sturdy, respect inspiring rows.
To punch the holes for the folder rings in the pages of text, I borrowed the puncher from the secretary of Manager of SMP-615 in the administrative building.
The new boss’s complexion grew green when saw me in his poultry farm, however, his sore spots did not qualify yet to be considered high-ranking enough…
</p><p>The folder with the collection of translated short stories was holstered into a festive-looking cellophane bag and I took it—bugle your trumpets, fanfarade! Roll, timpani, roll!—in the capital city of Kiev, to the book publishing house "Dnipro".
</p><p>In the first room, where I proudly announced the arrival of a collection of translations [Here! Here!] of short stories by William Somerset Maugham, the jovial young man informed that he was not the person in charge of Maugham, and the expert I needed was to be found two offices farther down the corridor. If would I like him to have me seen over there?
With dignified gratitude, I declined.
</p><p>In the indicated office, there sat a fat, but still young, man staring with disgust at a skinny pile of typewritten pages inside an open looseleaf folder of purple cardboard, with short white strings spread wantonly upon his desktop...
He reluctantly opened the heavy hard-plastic-armored file that I handed him over his desk, and glanced at the title of the first story in the collection.
</p><p class="centered2 bold">The Rain
</p><p>He shut the file abruptly and asked who I was sent by.
</p><p>In confused bewilderment, my mind revved to its limits:
...forbidden to come here on your own accord?.
...too high circles...I should have been sent by some or another duke***, so that the courtier-receptionist could guess whose vassal I was…to compare the duke's weight with that of his suzerain—marquis***—and know how to handle me...and then one phone call to verify—just in case—for him to decide to which drawer he might safely stick it in...and don’t you cherish no hope, under so polished a shebang, to find a hole for the f-f..er..I mean, freelancer-outsider.
</p><p>Meanwhile he, just in case, opened the volume once again, someplace in the middle, and immediately slammed it shut.
</p><p>"I'm just an errand-boy," answered I, "They asked me to take it to your publishing house, so I brought it here."
</p><p>"Who?"
</p><p>I opened the file to show the sticker on inside of its back cover with my Konotop address.
"This friend of mine," said I.
</p><p>It was below his position to talk to a messenger who was not sent by even somewhat petty baron but came from a nondescript Konotop or something of the sort...
I coldly replied to his official goodbye and left the room.
</p><p>The next evening, in Konotop, coming from work, I saw on my shelves a weighty postal package wrapped in their usual mustard-brown paper.
I had no reason to open the parcel. What for? By its size and familiar weight, I knew what was inside.
The annual report for the past six years of my life, comprising 472 typewritten pages of 35 short stories by W. S. Maugham, translated into Ukrainian.
</p><p>Strangely, the posted parcel hadn't reached Konotop before I came back from Kiev.
And it was also odd that the unopened package with unread stories left me so frostbitten indifferent.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...as it turned out, those six years did not fit into the feudally regulated grid of book publishing system.
</p><p>"Who sent you to our rectangularly arranged reality?"
</p><p>"Sorry, I've knocked on a wrong door..."
</p><p>Quoting the habitual saying of my Uncle Vadya: “Farewell, dear peers and peerixes, sirs and sirixes!”
</p><p>And he was a great connoisseur of vassal dependencies from the school textbook of the Middle Ages History...)</p>
