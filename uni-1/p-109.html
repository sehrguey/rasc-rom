  <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part one)<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Olga arrived in the middle of the day.
We were brought to the midday meal and they told me, "Your wife waits at the checkpoint guardhouse."
</p><p>I raced there, then to the Staff barrack, they gave me the Leave Ticket only until the next morning. Battalion Commander was not there, said they, the Ticket would be prolonged the following day after the Morning Dispensing, they said.
Then I barely found some parade-crap, the master sergeant was not there together with the storeroom key. But in a canvas outfit, the military patrols in the city would rake you in at once, be there even dozens Leave Tickets on you.
</p><p>So we got to the city only in the evening, but she had already had a room in the hotel: a one-person suite with a washbasin on the wall.
</p><p>Then some red-haired guy knocked at the door. Olga introduced him, meet please, we arrived by the same train together.
The fellow-traveler invited us to his room, where he had a party with his friends. We went over and on the way, Olga asked me to pretend that she was my sister – when on the train she jazzed him that she was visiting her brother.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...well, okay, then...
</p><p>Sarah and Abraham had also been there...)
</p></div><p>He had a long table in his room all filled with wine bottles, sort of a hussar banquet. Sometime earlier, he was a cadet at the Stavropol Military Aviation School but got expelled and now came there to see his friends, and all those  already were third-year cadets...
</p><p>I knew their Aviation School, out squad-team once were laying partitions in the basement of some building there. When the bell sounded and the cadets rushed to the classes from the yard, we combed trash pits in the gazebos hunting cigarette stubs…
Now they were sharing common memories with each other, toasting this and that from their mutual past.
</p><p>We also drank. And then I saw how that kicked-out cadet dropped his palm on Olga's knee.
 What to do? To surprise him with a bottle crushed against his pate? Not quite traditional treatment of your prospective brother-in-law though.
</p><p>Of course, she took his hand off and I, like, didn't see anything. Soon we left and back in our room she said, “Well, and so what of it?”
</p><p>Indeed, on Peace Square in Konotop when our whole passe lighted on a bench by the constantly dry fountain to have a smoke, they also stroked her knees and she as casually brushed their hands off.
Yet, we weren't married then…
</p><p>In the morning, when I ran to the UAZ van taking ensigns to the detachment, Jafarov rocked with laughter in its open back.
</p><p>"You ran as if in a slow-motion film stretch. Clearly doing your best, but still no progress. I swear by Mommy. Good luck there was no counter wind."
</p><p>They gave me the Leave Ticket only till the evening roll-call, dirty fuckers.
When I returned, Olga was still sleeping, in her blouse inside out.
</p><p>Then it was the time to check out, the room was for one day only.
I told her I should be back at the Battalion for the evening roll-call, and she said her train was also in the evening.
</p><p>We went to the cinema, some kind of a fairy tale about a Persian Hercules named Rostam...
Then we were sitting on a bench at the foot of the Komsomol Gorka Hill.
</p><p>She said that she had to go to the station, but no need to see her off, and she started to cry.
 The rare passers-by scoffed on the sly – a classical picture by Repin: the girl got pregnant but the soldier doesn't care a fuck.
</p><p>When she left, I sat on a little more and then went home…
</p><p>The next day in the Canteen, I knock-toppled a bowl of soup from the table. It spilled in my lap, scolding even through the canvas pants. I could not get it at all how it happened.
Everyone at the table looked up at me, strangely silent, and no one laughed.
</p><p>Spilled the soup in the lap...What sign could it be?
The blouse inside-out. Why?.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...it’s better not to think some thoughts, just leave them alone and if heedlessly started they’d better be dropped and not thought down the road to their inevitable conclusions...)
</p></div><p>Zampolit ordered the Club Director, Alexander Roodko, there should a brass band by the Victory Day, on May 9, or he'd get the boot and busted to a construction site as a plasterer's hand, and his Company master sergeant would rot him "on the floors" until his demobilization day.
</p><p>Of course, we pulled for The Orion leader and did not  let him down, in mere three weeks a brass band was thrown together.
Jafarov and Commissar, clear enough, were two horn players, Pickle played the baritone, Zameshkevich blew the tuba. As it turned out, in their schooldays, they participated in a brass music course.
Karpesha was the drummer, Roodko played the clarinet, the Club painter dubbed the big drum and mine was the main instrument in any brass band – two copper plates. Bzdents!!.
</p><p>Sasha Lopatko began his service in the same squad-team with me, but then his Dad came and held negotiations in the Staff barrack and Sasha was appointed the Club painter...
His Dad was, by the by, a priest and, probably, for that reason Sasha got to the construction battalion. Not anyone, after all, could be trusted with the handling of modern military weapons.
</p><p>We prepared two numbers: “On the Hills of Manchuria” and “Farewell of the Slav Woman”, not because we got way too scared by Zampolit's threat but simply a <em>lahbooh </em>would do what he could for to help out another <em>lahbooh.</em>
</p><p>On May 9, we changed into parade-craps and were taken by the UAZ van to different construction sites escorted by the "goat"-Willys carrying Zampolit.
Holidays were for idlers and the construction battalion warriors were always  on duty.
The squad-teams in the city were ordered to briefly leave their front of work and fall in nearby their respective construction sites. Zampolit pushed over a very short speech (the Battalion Commander with his leaky brain would start an oration for a half-hour without knowing what he was about at all), we played "The Slav" and "The Hills" and the sun shimmered playfully over the brass and copper...
 To have a holiday you do need a brass band…
</p><p>The following step in The Orion's career became the invitation to play one-night dances in the village club of Demino, located six kilometers farther from our detachment along the same asphalt road.
The musicians not only played but, replacing each other at the instruments, climbed, in turn, down from the small stage to the small hall to dance midst the local youth. Of all The Orions the pleasure was withheld only for Alexander Roodko, the irreplaceable bass guitarist.
</p><p>Under the long-long song sung by Robert Zakarian, I was embracing the ample-bodied villager Irina. Life was smiling on me…
</p><p>Before his demobilization, Yura Zameshkevich reported to Major Avetissian, the Battalion Supply and Maintenance Commander, that no one but I was qualified to replace him at the position of the Battalion Stoker.
Zameshkevich's statement was actively backed by a Battalion Cook Vladimir Rassolov, aka Pickle, who had still another half-year to serve. In the course of the petition, the chef congratulated the Supply and Maintenance Commander on obtaining the long-awaited-for rank of Major.
As a result, Major Avetissian granted my enrollment to the glorious ranks of<em> chmo.</em>
</p><p>The collective name of <em>chmo </em>was used to specify all the servicemen engaged in the internal battalion services: the pigman, dishwashers, stokers, cooks, the locksmith, the tailor, the shoemaker, the projectionist, the drivers of the vehicles for the commanding officers, as well as the assistant paramedic at the first aid unit – anyone, in short, who was not fortunate enough to work at construction sites was a part of the <em>chmo </em>reporting to Major Avetissian.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...initially, CHMO was the acronym of "man messing around with the society" but soon because of its so impressive sound form the term forced to forget the original meaning and nowadays everyone thinks that <em>chmo </em>is a synonym of "wafler" only more degrading...)
</p></div><p>Before his return to civilian life, Yura Zameshkevich showed me the location of the water well with the water supply valves for filling the water tank above the stoker-house. He taught me to light the nozzle in the steam boiler furnace with a torch, to read the water measuring tube and the pressure gauge.
I was transferred to Fourth Company where all the <em>chmo</em> was listed, and Yura got demobilized.
</p><p>The young draft was from the Crimea and Major Avetissian chose me a partner from them named Vanya who sported a thin mustache and thick eyebrows.
</p><p>It's highly doubtful that Major Avetissian's choice of Vanya was prompted by the eyebrows' thickness of the latter. Most likely, Vanya's father, who came to see his offspring on the third day of sonny’s service, found convincing arguments when negotiating with the Major.
I shared Yura Zameshkevich's lectures with Vanya and we began to work dividing 24-hour into two shifts.</p>
