<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>At times the parents’ shifts did not coincide so that one of them was home while the other at work. At one such time, Dad brought me to Mom’s workplace – a squat brick building with a dark green door behind which, just opposite the entrance, there was a small room with a small window up above a big old desk and two chairs. But if bypassing that room, you turned to the left through a brown door, there would be a huge murky hall full of incessant rumble and with another desk at which Mom sat doing her job.
</p><p>She didn’t expect us and was so very much surprised.
Then she showed me the log under the lamp on her desk because it was her job to write down the time and figures from the round manometers’ faces to which there led narrow bridges of iron-sheets all rigged up with handrails because under them everywhere was dark water for the pumps to pump. And those pumps made that terrible noise all the time so that for talking we had to shout loud but even then not all the words were heard, “What!? What!?”
</p><p>So, we returned to the room by the entrance where Mom took from a drawer in the desk a pencil and some spare old log with missing pages for me to do some hazy-mazy drawings.
</p><p>After I drew a big sun, she asked if I wanted to go and play in the yard. I did not want to go out, but then Dad said if I didn’t listen to Mom he never-never would bring me there again anymore, and I went out.
</p><p>The yard was just the piece of a grass-grown pebble road from the gate to the log shed a short way from the right corner of the Pumping Station. And behind the Station building, there rose a sheer steep overgrown with nettles.
</p><p>I returned to the green door from which a short concrete path led to a small white hut without any window and a padlock on the black iron door. How could you play in such a place?
</p><p>Two rounded knolls bulged high on either side of the hut twice taller than it. Grabbing at the tufts of long grass, I climbed the right one.
</p><p>From that height, the roof of the hut and the roof of Pumping Station were seen in full, and in the opposite direction beyond the fence behind the knoll foot there stretched a strip of bush and ran a river sparkling brightly, but I would certainly get punished if I went out of the gate.
</p><p>For any further playing at all, there remained only the other knoll with a thin tree on its top. I went down to the hut, bypassed it from behind and climbed the second knoll.
</p><p>From up there, everything turned out to be the same as from the previous knoll, only that there you could touch the tree. Hot and sweaty after the climbing, I lay down under it.
</p><p>What’s that?!. Something stung me at the thigh and then at the other, and then over and over again.
</p><p>I turned around and peeked over my shoulder behind my back. A swarm of red ants was busily bustling about my legs below the shorts of yellow corduroy. I smacked them away but the scorching merciless stings kept increasing in numbers…
</p><p>Mom jumped out from behind the green door to my wailing, and Dad after her too. He ran up to me and carried me down on his hands. The ants were brushed off, but the swollen, reddened thighs still burned unbearably.
</p><p>And that served me a lesson for the rest of my life – there is no better remedy for the bites of those red beasts than being seated into the sling of the cool green silk in the hem of Mom’s dress stretched taut between her knees.
</p><p>Grandma Martha lived in the same room with us, her three grandchildren, her narrow iron bed stood in the corner to the right from the door, opposite the cumbersome structure of a mighty sofa with upright leatherette back in the wooden frame and the cylinders of hinged armrests bordering the wide leatherette seat on which the twins were bedded for the night.
</p><p>Along the top plank in the back’s frame, there ran a narrow shelf alongside with the low mirror inserted behind it to reflect the small figurines of white elephant parade lined in a file on the shelf, from the tallest leader to the bantam baby.
 </p><p>The elephants had long since lost and the varnished shelf remained empty, except for when we were playing Train constructed of legs-up stools brought from the kitchen and chairs tumbled on their backs, and with the nightfall in the train car, I climbed onto the shelf although its narrowness allowed only for stretching on one your side.
</p><p>The Train game became more interesting when Lyda and Yura Zimins, the children of our neighbors, crossed the landing to join us in our room.
 Then Train became even longer and we, sitting inside the up-legged stool-cars, swayed them with all might and main, so that they tap-tapped on the floor, evoking Grandma’s grumbles and orders to stop raging like zealots.
</p><p>When the games and supper were over, my aluminum folding bed was set up in the middle of the room. Mom brought and spread the mattress over it, and a blue oilcloth too, under the sheet, in case I peed in sleep, then a huge pillow, and the thick wool-filled blanket to complete my bed.
</p><p>Grandma Martha turned off the radio box hanging on the left wall by the door and clicked the light switcher. However, the darkness in the room was quite relative – the lights from the windows in the neighboring corner building and from the lampposts in the courtyard penetrated the mesh of tulle window curtains, and from under the door, there sneaked in a sliver of light from the corridor between the kitchen and the parents’ bedroom.
</p><p>I watched the dark silhouette of Grandma Martha as she stood by her bed and whispered something up to the ceiling corner above her head. The strange activity didn’t bother me in the least after Mom's' explanation that it was Grandma Martha’s way of praying to God and that the parents could not allow her to hang an icon in the same corner because our Dad was a Party member…
</p><p>The hardest problem in the morning was finding my stockings. Believe it or not, but even boys in those days wore stockings. Over the underpants, there was donned a special garter belt to button on its front two short rubber bands each ending with a clip-fastener. Such clip-fastener consisted of a rubber nipple squeezed through a tight-fitting wireframe. The frame was raised to pull a pinch of the stocking top over the nipple and then forced into the tight loophole of the wireframe – clip!. Ugh!.
</p><p>All that harness, of course, was put on me by Mom, however, finding the stockings was my responsibility, and they somehow managed to always find a new place for hiding. Mom would keep urging from the kitchen to come for breakfast, “Can you dress quicker, slow duck?!” Because she, after all, had to be in time for her work, while those meanies were nowhere to trace.
</p><p>At last – peekaboo! – I spotted the nose of one of them sticking from under the hinged armrest of the sofa with the still sleeping twins. Of course, it called for Mom’s help to get them out and not to waken Sasha up…
</p><p>Weary with regular morning earfuls, I found an elegant solution to the problem of disappearing stockings and, with the light in the room switched off already but Grandma Martha still gossiping with her God in a whisper, I tied them to my ankles, separately.
</p><p>My brother and sister with their pillows on the opposite armrests of the big sofa were, as always, kicking each other under their common blanket and could not follow my subtle manipulations in the dark. And I was in time to cover my legs when Mom entered our room to kiss her children goodnight.
Yet, quite unexpectedly she did something   never done before. Mom switched on the light, who lived under the ceiling in the bulb inside the orange shade of silk fringed with hanging bangs and threw the blanket off my legs discovering the stocking shackles on each of my ankles. “Something had just pulled me to do it”, she later told Dad with a laugh.
</p><p>I had to untie the stockings and leave them atop the bundle of my other clothes on the chair next to my folding bed without realization so a brilliant solution…
</p><p>In all fairness, the most unpleasant part of my kindergarten life was going to bed after the midday meal for the “quiet hour”. You had to take off your clothes and put them on a small white stool and, no matter how carefully you did it, at getting up after the “quiet hour” the clothes would be in quite a mess, and the stocking fastener in one or another garter would stubbornly refuse to do its job.
</p><p>Besides, what’s the use of idle lying for a whole hour staring at the white ceiling or the white window curtains, or along the long row of cots with a narrow passage after each pair of them?
</p><p>The children would lie silently in that row ending at the far off white wall with the caretaker sitting by it reading her book, occasionally distracted by some or other child who would approach her asking in a whisper for permission to go out to the toilet. And after her whispered permission, she would in a low voice silence the rustle of whispering arising along the row of cots, “Well, everyone shut your eyes and sleep!”
</p><p>Maybe, at times I did fall asleep at that “quiet hour”, though more often it was just numb drowsiness with my eyes open but not seeing the white ceiling from the white sheet drawn over my head…
</p><p>And suddenly the drowsiness was cast off with a gentle touch of cautious fingers creeping from my knee up over the thigh. I looked out from under the sheet. Irochka Likhachova was lying on the next cot with her eyes closed tightly, but in between the sheets over our cots, I could clearly make out a length of her outstretched arm.
</p><p>The quiet fingers dived into my underpants to enclose my flesh in a  warm soft palm. It felt unspeakably pleasant. But then her touch moved away from my private parts – why? yet more!
</p><p>Her hand found mine and pulled it under her sheet to put my palm on something soft and yielding that had no name, which it did not need at all because all I needed was that all that just went on and on.
</p><p>However, when I, with my eyes tightly closed, once again brought her hand back under my sheet, she stayed there all too briefly before pulling mine over to hers.
</p><p>At that moment the caretaker announced the end of “quiet hour” and called all to get up. The room filled with the hubbub of dressing children.
</p><p>“And we don’t forget to make our beds,” the caretaker repeated instructively, walking to and fro along the runner by the cots’ row, when all of a sudden Irochka Likhachova shouted, “And Ogoltsoff got into my panties!” The children lulled in expectation.
</p><p>Sledgehammered with the disgraceful truth, I felt a hot wave of shame rolling up to splash tears out of my eyes.
</p><p>“It’s you got into! Fool!” roared I and ran out of the room to the second-floor landing tiled with alternating squares of yellow and brown. Stopping there, I decided to never ever any more return to that group and that kindergarten. No, never ever anymore. That was enough of enoughs.
</p><p>But I didn’t have time to think about how I would live on further because I was bewitched by the red fire extinguisher on the wall. In fact, it was not the whole fire extinguisher that my gaze got nailed to but the yellow square on its side with a picture where a man in a cap on his head held exactly the same fire extinguisher, only upside down already, with the expanding gush from it directed to a fat bush of flames.
</p><p>The picture was intended, probably, to serve a kind of visual instruction on how to use this or any other fire extinguisher, for which reason the one in the man’s hands was painted fully true to life. Even the yellow square with the instructive picture on its side was scrupulously reproduced, portraying a little man in a tiny cap who fought, standing upside down, the undersized fire with the gush from his miniature fire extinguisher.
</p><p>Then and there it dawned on me that in the next, already blurred, picture on that miniature extinguisher the already indiscernible man was back again to his normal position – feet down. Yet, in the still next, further reduced, picture he would be on his head once more and—the most breathtaking discovery!—these diminishing men just could not end, they would only grow smaller, receding to unimaginably tiny specks and dwindle on without ever ending their dwarfish tumbles, serving each other  a link and a spring-board to ever turning tinier simply because of that Fire Extinguisher who started them off from his nail in the wall on the second floor landing next to the white door to the senior group, opposite the door to the toilet.
</p><p>The spell was shattered into pieces with the awakening calls to me to immediately come to the dining room where the kindergarten groups were seated already for the after-“quiet-hour” tea. Yet, ever since, passing below Fire Extinguisher–the bearer of innumerable worlds–I felt respectful understanding.
</p><p>As for getting into someone else’s panties, that was my only and unique experience. And enlightened by it, when during following “quiet hours” I had to go, with the undertone permission from the caretaker, out to pee then, passing by, I fully knew the meaning of sheets overlapping the gap between a pair of coupled cots, as well as why so earnestly were closed the eyes of Khromov in his cot next to the Sontseva’s…
