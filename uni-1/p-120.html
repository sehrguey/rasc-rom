<p>But then I finally visit her at home.
As it turned out, her staircase-entrance was different from where I escorted her on our first date, and the building itself was half-block farther along the endless sidewalk.
</p><p>When I took my boots off in the hallway and stuck the footcloths into them as deep as I could, so that they wouldn't propagate their smell too freely, it turned out that I was barefoot and even slippers did not hide that fact – like a god's fool only without a besom...
At home, she happened to have her mother and a daughter of three years old.
</p><p>Then her mother took her daughter for a walk to a store and we got seated on the carpet where she brought and opened her album with photos.
Both in the pictures and on the carpet, she looked real cute that quiet mouse blonde Tanya.
</p><p>All there was to do for having a sex on the carpet next to the spread album was just to reach out and put my hand on her shoulder skin inside her gown, but  something hampered the most natural move.
I do not know what exactly stopped me. What did I wait for?
</p><div id="span"><p>(....in those irrevocably faraway times—past any reach, recall, redress—I hadn't realized yet that all my grieves and joys and stuff sprang from that rascal in the unfathomably distant future who’s now composing this letter to you stretched on my back inside this here one-person tent surrounded by a dark forest in the middle of nowhere and the never subsiding whoosh of the river  currently named Varanda...)
</p></div><p>Then her mother returned from the store bringing back Tanya’s daughter and a mesh-bag bulging with bright oranges...
</p><p>Our following meetings took place outside her apartment, and she began to show interest in studying my military ID.
The balls about my ID locked up in the safe at the Commander’s office did not roll far with her – she was two years older than me.
</p><p>Then there cropped up some nagging predicaments and confusions in the otherwise peaceful flow of my service. I got in a scrape or two, and we lost sight of each other.
Already before the demobilization, I went to visit her again, but her mother said Tanya was not home.
</p><p>I waited for her at the staircase-entrance and, when she eventually appeared, we went out to a wide night courtyard between the five-story apartment-blocks and she succumbed both readily and quietly on a table in the playgrounds.
However, I cum too soon, much faster than in that staircase-entrance which outcome I did not like at all and broke off our relationship, in conformance with the demand of Captain Pissak, Commander of First Company. Because, as it stands in the Statute of the Internal Military Service, "an order of the commander is the law for a lower-ranked serviceman"…
</p><p>The closer the demobilization, the shorter is your sleep.
Where have you retired, O, the euphoric times when I, still a <em>salaga, </em>was falling asleep the moment my head touched the pillow? An enviable bliss..
And now, the evening roll-call over, the long aimless visit to the Club paid, again I'm plodding back to the barrack without any hope to get a wink of sleep...
So, we get together, the nighthawks of the same feather, and stretched upon bunk beds in one or another <em>koobrik,</em> we gossip  of this, we gossip  of that, or just drive a fool.
</p><div id="span"><p>(....many years later I learned from Solzhenitsyn's <em>The Gulag Archipelago</em> that it was an old traditional pastime among<em> zeks</em>, inherited from the Czarist times when someone in the cell retold some novel by some Dickens with adaptations and retouch of the details to bring them closer to the everyday contemporary  life.
Only instead of "driving a fool" <em>zeks </em>called it "stamping a novel"...)
</p></div><p>When it was my turn, I stamped a novel of revenge about two young lovers and a cruel baron from the castle on a nearby hill.
That heinous brute of a baron imprisoned the young man in the dark dungeon cell illuminated only when he brought in a couple of torches along with  his beloved to use her as a sex slave right in front of the poor guy.
A month later, the prisoner tore out the peg that fixed his chain to the wall and paid the bills for lodging and warm hospitality.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...the plot had nothing to do with Dickens or any particular literary work  because when driving that fool I, with my closed eyes, watched the gossamery blouse of Michelle Mercier presenting her tits in the first sequel of "Angelica".
However, here arises the question: if I have farmed out my Michelle to the baron applying her (one whole month!) to tickle his senile fantasies, taking turns with his wolfhound and various objects of medieval utensils and implements, then (even though jerking at the peg in the futile attempts to pull it from the wall, but still collaboratively keeping time with the concurrent porno scenes) may it be I'm a pervert?
</p><p>Of course, the question was forwarded not by the listeners but by myself, and much later too, but still and all...)
</p></div><p>During the epilogue centered on the methodical dismantling of the baron in the constituent parts performed in monstrously graphical manner, Khmel suddenly wailed, "Hey, on-duty!" 
</p><p>From the cabinet-box by the faraway barrack entrance, the on-duty came and Khmel told him, "He had fucking fucked already with his snoring, dome the fucker, let him RIP."
</p><p>"Who?"
</p><p>"In the<em> koobrik </em>over two passages."
</p><p>The on-duty bent over the peace disturber and listened to the sleepy breathing, "No, not this one."
</p><p>Lyolik joined in the conversation, "Who the fuck cares? Dome the fucker all the same!"
</p><div id="span"><p>(...the depth of philosophical wisdom of the utterance still brings the tears of tender delight to my eyes.
</p><figure><p class="centered2 bold ital">"Who the fuck cares? Dome the fucker all the same!."
</p></figure><p>Here! Here it is – the quintessence of statuary and other service relations, the pledge of having a well-trained army, marked with combat zeal and readiness...
</p><p>I’d be happy to add of the "Soviet army", the one that's plopped into oblivion... but who nowadays believes in Father Christmas?..)
</p></div><p>A soldier-dembel pines away under incessant  tension. A state of incomprehensible, groundless anxiety deprives him of sleep, appetite, and the ability to assess and conform his actions with the requirements of elementary logic and common sense...
Every morning, the buddies from your draft get lined up in groups facing the ranks of the Morning Dispensing and, after a brief farewell from Zampolit, or Chief of Staff, they march  to the gate by the checkpoint, they go home.
And when would my turn  come?!.
</p><p>After idling around to three o'clock at the location of VSO-11, I got in the cabin of UAZ-66 truck used for fetching bread to the Canteen from Stavropol.
Under the canvas top of the truck back, climbed Lyolik and some of his buddies, also going to AWOL.
</p><p>The truck left through the gate and sped to the city along the asphalt road wet after the recent thunderstorm. The asphalt closer to the roadsides was all ruts and holes so the white car that jumped out of the road turn was darting along the middle.
The UAZ driver dodged, leaping with the right wheels of the truck onto the muddy roadside. The turn was rushing at him – he both swerved left and hit the brakes. The truck jumped back onto the road and skidded along in a free-style gliding.
</p><p>The driver, next to me, was frantically spinning the wheel hither-thither and back again. The truck kept speedily crabbing along, changing the sides at her will, paying no attention to what the driver did to the wheel. In the end, we were turned in the opposite direction and, after traveling backward for some time, the truck capsized...
The embankment was not too high—about two meters—so we rotated just a couple of times.
</p><p>Tumbling under the slope inside the cab of a truck, you live through a strange sensation as if you were a fish in a bowl. Probably, that is weightlessness. The driver, the wheel, the cab door, and once again the hovering driver are slowly floating past you…
I landed on him when the motion stopped leaving the truck on her side. Yet, the driver was the first to climb out through the window overhead. I followed him.
</p><p>The buddies from the truck back were already standing by the driver. Lucky guys...
On the road, the Battalion Commander's "goat"-Willys squeaked its brakes.
 To simplify the pending assessment of the situation, I merged with the green foliage of the forest edge.
</p><p>"Who else was that?"
</p><p>"I dunno, some soldier from Separate Company asked to take him along..."
</p><p>After two kilometers, the forest was over, and so was the tense tremor in my hands, when I entered the city.
I went to a cinema to take off the adrenaline rush. It was "How to Steal a Million" with Peter O'Toole. Or was it "The Remarriage" with Belmondo?
</p><p>Nah! After Belmondo, I met Nadya, a student of something there.
We walked for a long time, hugging here and there, but when I went over to kisses, she bit my tongue. "I know what you're hinting at!"
</p><p>Stuff it! What hints were there?
It hurt so, I could hardly speak when seeing her to the one-story house where she rented a room.
</p><p>She dropped in and brought out a can of condensed milk; kinda emolument to the wrongly wounded warrior. I hugged her for goodbye but shunt kissing.
</p><p>When she left, I looked at the can in my hand then at the wall of the house. No stray nails... So I placed the can on the railing and went away bypassing the pleasure for my bitten tongue…
