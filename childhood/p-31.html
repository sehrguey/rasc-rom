<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>On the winter holidays, I learned that the boys from both blocks on the Gorka often visited the Regiment Club to watch movies there. The Regiment was where the soldiers carried on their army service after graduating from the Recruit Depot Barracks.
</p><p>Going there for the first time was a bit scary because of the vague rumors among children about some soldier strangling some girl in the forest. No one could explain how and why, but that bad soldier must have been a “blackstrapper” while in the Regiment all the soldiers wore red shoulder straps.
</p><p>The way to the Regiment was not short – two times as long as to school which you bypassed on the right and the trail became wider and straighter, bound with the walls of tall fir trees until you went out onto the asphalt road which ended by the gate with sentries, however, they did not stop boys and you could go on to the building with the signboard Regiment Club.
</p><p>Inside, you got into a wide long corridor with three double doors in its blind wall. The other wall had windows in it and between them, as well as between the double doors, there hung a row of same-sized pictures portraying different soldiers and officers with short descriptions of their selfless deeds and heroic deaths defending our Soviet Homeland.
</p><p>The wide double doors opened to a huge hall without windows filled with rows of plywood seats all facing the wide stage with  crimson velvet curtains. They were partly drawn to both sides so as to open the wide white screen for movies.  From the stage to the back wall, that had a pair of square black holes high up near the ceiling for movie projection, stretched the long passage dividing the hall into two equal halves…
</p><p>The soldiers entered in groups, speaking loudly, stomping their boots at the boards of the paint-coated floor and  gradually they filled the seats with their uniformed mass and the whole of the hall with the  thick indistinct hum of their talking to each other.
</p><p>Time dragged awfully slowly. There were no pictures on the whitewashed walls and I re-read, over and over again, the two inscriptions on the red-clothed frames that screened the speaker boxes on both sides of the stage.
</p><p>A portrait of a cut-out bearded head with the thick turf of hair was mounted onto the left frame and followed by the lines: “In science, there is no wide highway, and only they who fear no fatigue but keep climbing its stony footpaths will reach its shiny peaks.” The concluding line underneath explained whose head and words they were – “K. Marx.”
</p><p>And, next to the velvet folds of the curtain drawn to the right, a head without hair and with a small wedge-like beard made it clear even before reaching the bottom-most line that it was Lenin who curtly said, “The cinema is not only an agitator but also a remarkable organizer of the masses.”
</p><p>As the soldiers filled the entire hall, the schoolboys moved from the front rows over onto the stage and watched the movies from the backside of the taut screen. Not much difference if Amphibian Man dived from the cliff left to right contrary to what saw the watchers in the hall. And the rebel Kotovsky would all the same escape from the courtroom through the window... Although, some boys stayed in the hall perching on the armrests between the seats because the soldiers did not mind.
</p><p>At times, in the darkness illuminated by the flicks of the running film, there sounded a yell from one of the three double doors, “Lance-corporal Solopov!.”
 </p><p>Or else, “The second squad!.” But any yell ended the same way, “To the exit!”
</p><p>If the movie suddenly broke off and the hall sank in complete darkness, there arose a deafening wall of whistles and rambling boot-stomp at the floor and yells “shoemaker!!.” from all the sides…
</p><p>After the movies at the Regiment Club, we walked home through the night forest retelling each other the episodes of what we had just watched together, “Now! I say! The way he punched him!” “Hey! Hey! I say! The guy never knew what hit him!”
</p><p>Of course, the Regiment Club was not the only place for movie-going. There always remained the House of Officers but there you had to buy a ticket and, therefore, come with your parents, yet they never had time for movies.
True, on Sundays, they demonstrated there a free film for schoolchildren: black-and-white fairy tales or a color film about the young partisan pioneer Volodya Dubinin…
</p><p>One Sunday morning, I told Mom that I was going out to play.
</p><p>“Think before you speak up! Who  plays  outside in such a weather? Look!”
</p><p>  The scudding shoots of rime snow scratch-and-scraped the murky dusk outside the panes in the kitchen window.
</p><p>“See this mayhem?”
</p><p>But I croaked and grumbled and never got off her back until Mom grew angry and told me to go wherever I wished.
</p><p>I went out into the boundless Courtyard. No one at all; the desolate space around looked so too gloomy to stay in. With my face turned away from the snappy slaps from the wild snow torrents, I bypassed the house corner and crossed the road to the field next to the nailed up garbage enclosure.
</p><p>There also was nobody except for me, but I couldn’t see myself. All I could see was the complete turmoil full of the violent blizzard lashing the dull gray world with the long snake-like belts of prickly snow.
 I felt lonely and wished I was back home. But Mom would say, “So I told you!”, and the younger would start giggling.
</p><p>Then from the far edge of the field where long-long ago they played volleyball and <em>gorodki</em> in summer, there came a voice of the aluminum loudspeaker on top of a wooden post not seen through so hurly-burly weather, “Dear children! Today we’ll learn the song about Merry Drummer. Listen to it first.” And a well-trained quire of children's voices began to sing of a clear morning at the gate, and the maple drumsticks in the hands of Merry Drummer.
</p><p>The song was over and the announcer commenced to dictate the lyrics so that the listeners by their radios would write it down word for word, “Get up ear-ly, get up ear-ly, get up ear-ly, with the first light of the mor-ning by the gate…”
</p><p>And I already was not alone in the grim world getting its lashing. I waded through the snowdrifts but the snow could not get me because of my thick pants pulled tightly over my felt boots.
 The announcer finished dictating the first verse, and let me listen to it sung by the quire. Then he dictated the second, also with the subsequent singing through it, and the third.
</p><p>“Now, listen to the whole song, please.”
</p><p>And there became quite a lot of us – both Merry Drummer, and the children with their merry voices, and even the blizzard turned into one of us and wandered with me across the field, hither and thither. Only that I kept falling through the crust into the sifted powder snow under it, and the blizzard danced above, scattering its prickly pellets.
</p><p>When I got home Mom asked, “Well, seen anyone there?”
</p><p>I said “no” but no one laughed.
</p><p>The solitary walk in the big company, under the dictation about Merry Drummer, laid me up in bed with the temperature. It was strangely quiet all around with everyone gone to work and to school.
</p><p>Because the books from the Detachment’s Library finished and there was no one to go and exchange them for me, I had to pick one from our home library that filled a shelf in the closet of the cupboard in the parents’ room. After a certain hesitation, I chose the one that for a long time had been attracting me by its title, yet at the same time repelled with its thickness, the four volumed <em>War and Peace</em> by Tolstoy.
</p><p>The opening chapter confirmed my fears by its text in French running page after page, however, it eased off when I noticed that there was a translation in the footnotes...
 Because of that novel, I did not notice my illness but hastily swallowed the medicines and hurried back to Pierre, Andrey, Petya, Natasha...at times forgetting to take thermometer from out of my armpit.
</p><p>I read all the volumes and the epilogue, yet the concluding part – the discourse on predestination, I couldn’t overcome. Its endless sentences turned into a bluff of glass where, climbing up for a tad bit, I invariably slipped back to its foot. The insurmountable bluff stretched in both directions, and there was no way to figure out where I got to that point from. The last volume was closed without reading it up to the very end.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…a couple of years ago I re-read the novel, from cover to cover, and said that if a person was capable of writing like Tolstoy in that concluding part of <em>War and Peace</em> then why bothering themselves with all that prelude fiction, including the epilogue?
</p><p>Probably, I kinda showed off, in part, but only just in part…)
