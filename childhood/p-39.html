<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>With bicycles, I palled up since early childhood. I can’t even remotely remember my first tricycle, but some photos confirm: here it is with the pedals on the front wheel and me, straggling it, a three-year-old fat little man in a closely fitting skull cap.
</p><p>However, the next one I recollect pretty well – a red three-wheeler with the chain drive – because I often had to argue with my brother and sister whose turn it was to take a ride. Later, Dad reassembled it into a two-wheeler but, after my fifth grade, the bicycle became too small for me and was hand-me-downed to the younger for good.
</p><p>And then Dad got somewhere a real bike for me. Yes, it was a second-hand one but not a bike for ladies or some kind of “Eaglet” for grown-up kids.
</p><p>One evening after his work, Dad even tried to teach me riding it in the Courtyard, but without his supporting hand on the saddle, I would fall on one side if not on the other.
 Dad got tired of my clumsiness, he said, “Learn it yourself!” and went home.
</p><p>In a couple of days, I could already ride the bike. However, I didn’t get the nerve to throw my leg over the saddle and perch up properly, instead, I passed my leg through the frame and rode standing on the pedals, which caused the bike to run askew.
</p><p>But then I got ashamed seeing a boy who, though younger than me, was not afraid to race along with his bike, step onto a pedal and flung the other leg over the saddle to the second pedal. His body length did not allow to use the saddle without losing touch with the pedals so turning them he rubbed his crotch against the frame which also served him for sitting upon with his left or right thigh, alternatively. On so brave shortie’s background, riding the bike “under the frame” was quite a shame…
</p><p>And at last, after so many tries and falls ending both with and without bruises or scratches, I did it!
  Wow! How swiftly carried me the bike above the ground – no one would ever catch up be they even running! And – most important – riding a bicycle was such an easy thing!
 </p><p>I rode it non-stop driving along the concrete paths in the Courtyard, orbiting its two wooden gazebos until, a bit warily, I steered  out to the road of concrete slabs surrounding the two Gorka blocks…
</p><p>Later, becoming an experienced rider, I started mastering the bikerobatics – “riding without the handles”, when you take your hands off the steer and pilot the bicycle with feeding your body weight to the side you want it to turn to. And the bike understood me!.
</p><p>Another achievement of that summer became  keeping the eyes open when under the water.
</p><p>The dam where I once slipped off the slab was restored to bring about a wide bathing pool that attracted numerous beach-goers.
</p><p>Among us, boys, the favorite game in the water was “spotting” where the “it” should catch up with and touch one of the fleeing players. You can’t walk through the water as quickly as a swimmer. Besides, a player can take a dive and  change the direction of his getting away, so it’s hard to guess where he would come back to the surface for a breather. Ever before, when plunging in the water, I firmly closed my eyes but that way you can’t detect flicking of white heels that kick full ahead underwater.
</p><p>True enough, in the ever-present yellowish twilight beneath the surface, you can’t see very far, but sounds are heard way more clearly if you sit down there and knock, say, two gravels against each other.
 However, you cannot sit underwater for a long time – the air in your lungs pulls you up to the surface and there’s no other way to resist the up-drive but rowing with your hands so the gravels should be dropped…
</p><p>My parents’ leaves did not coincide that summer so they went for their vacations in turn.
First, Dad visited his native village of Kanino in the Ryazan region. He took me with him there, after a strict warning that on the way I should not ever tell anyone that we lived at the Atomic Object.
</p><p>At the station of Bologoye, we had a long wait for the train to Moscow. Leaving me seated on our suitcase in the station waiting room, Dad went to punch the tickets. On a nearby bench, a girl was sitting with an open book in her lap. I got up and neared the girl to look in the book over her shoulder. It was<em> The Mysterious Island </em>by Jules Verne.
</p><p>I read a couple of paragraphs of the familiar lines I liked so much. She kept reading and didn’t pay any attention to me standing behind the bench back.
 I wanted to speak up to her, but I did not know what to say. That that was a good book? That I had also read it?
</p><p>While I was looking for the right words to say, her adults came and announced that their train was arriving. They grabbed their trunks and went out to the platform to board the train. She never looked back…
</p><p>Then my Dad returned with the punched tickets. At my request, he bought me a book from a bookstall about a Hungarian boy who later became a youth and fought against the Austrian invaders of his homeland.
</p><p>When the ping-ponging echo from the loudspeaker announced the arrival of our train, we went out to the platform. A ten-or-so-year-old boy passed by.
</p><p>“See?” said Dad to me. “That’s what poverty is!”
 </p><p>I looked after the boy who walked away, and noticed the rough patches in the back of his pants…
</p><p>In Moscow, we arrived the next morning.
I wanted to see the capital of our Homeland from its very beginning and kept asking when Moscow would, at last, start, until the conductor said that we were in the city already.
</p><p>But behind the pane in the car’s window, there were running the same shabby log huts as at the stations of Valdai, only much more of them and closer to each other, and they did not want to end in any way. And only when our train pulled in under the high arc of the station roof, I believed that it was Moscow.
</p><p>We went on foot to the other station which was very close. There Dad again punched the tickets but that time we had to wait until evening for the train, so he handed the suitcase over to the storage room and we boarded an excursion bus going to the Kremlin.
</p><p>Inside the Kremlin walls, they warned that we shouldn’t take any pictures whatsoever. Dad had to demonstrate there was no camera in the leather case hanging from his shoulder but his homemade radio which they allowed to keep only now I had to carry it on.
</p><p>There were white-walled houses in the Kremlin and dark fir trees, but too few, although thick-trunked and tall.
</p><p>The excursion was brought to the Czar Bell with its chopped out wall. It happened when the Czar Bell fell from the belfry and couldn’t ring ever since, which was a pity.
 And when we came to the Czar Cannon, I instantly climbed the pile of the large polished cannonballs under her nose and shoot my head into the muzzle. It looked like insides of a huge pipe with lots of dust on the circular wall.
</p><p>“Whose kid is that?! Take him away!!” cried some man outside the cannon, running up from the nearest fir tree.
</p><p>Dad admitted that I was his and, until we left the Kremlin, he had to hold me by the hand, though the day was hot.
</p><p>When the bus returned to the railway station, Dad said that he needed to buy a watch, although he did not have much money. So, we went to the store where there were lots of different watches under the glass of the countertop, and Dad asked me which one to buy.
</p><p>Remembering his complaint that he was short of money, I pointed at the cheapest – for seven rubles, but Dad did not obey and bought an expensive wristwatch – for twenty-five…
</p><p>In the village of Kanino, we lived in the log hut of Grandma Martha, made up of one large room with two windows and a tall Russian stove.
</p><p>Behind the hut, there was a  lean-to of logs attached to it. The windowless lean-to was empty, strewn with stray wisps of old hay, and smelled of dust.
 There I found three books: a historical novel about the general Bagration in the war of 1812 against Napoleon invasion, a long story of how they established the Soviet rule among the Indians of the Chukchi Peninsula, and <em>The Little Prince</em> by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.
</p><p>Once, my Dad’s brother and sister came to visit, they both lived in the same village but were too busy at the collective farm, kolkhoz. Grandma Martha cooked a round yellow omelet for the occasion; I don’t remember the meals on other days…
</p><p>The village of Kanino was divided into two parts by the hollow with a slowly rolling, broad and noiseless, creek. The banks of it were one wall of an uninterrupted willow thicket. And the stream was pretty shallow – a little bit above the knees, with a pleasant sandy bottom. I liked to wander in its slow current.
</p><p>One day Dad took me to the Mostya river. It was a very long walk but in the end, there was enough of the river to swim from one grassy bank to the other. There were many people on both banks too, probably, from other villages.
</p><p>On our way back we saw a combine harvesting wheat in the field. We stopped at the edge of the field to watch and when the harvester drove past to the other edge, Dad spat and angrily said, “Phui, hooey!”
</p><p>As it turned out, the combine driver was mowing the shoots at their tops, so as to finish his job quicker, but when he saw a stranger in a white tank top together with a boy of urban appearance, he decided my Dad was some big wheel from the district administration on a recreation visit and, driving past us, he mowed the shoots close to the ground…
</p><p>Near Grandma Martha’s lean-to, there appeared a large haystack and when Dad together with his brother began some repair work inside her log hut, Grandma Martha moved to spend nights in the lean-to, and the bed for me and Dad was made atop the haystack.
</p><p>Sleeping up there was convenient and pleasant because of the smell of withering grass, but a bit unusual and even scary for all the stars above watching you all the time. Besides, the roosters started crying before the dawn and then you had just to lay in the twilight before dropping off again…
</p><p>One day I went up the creek, as far as another village, there was an earthen dam built by that village boys to make a pond for swimming. But after that, I fell ill and was taken to the same upstream village because only there was infirmary with three beds.
</p><p>On one of those three beds, I was ill almost a whole week reading <em>The Standard Bearers</em> by Gonchar and eating the strawberry jam brought by Dad’s sister, Aunt Sasha, or maybe it was his brother’s wife, Aunt Anna, because they came together to see me.
</p><p>So we spent Dad’s vacation and returned to the Object…</p>
