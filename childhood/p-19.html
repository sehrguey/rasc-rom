<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The trail to school had become quite familiar, yet each time a little different.
 The foliage fell, the droughts began roaming between the naked tree trunks and the school was peeping through them even before you reached the big aspen by the swamp, on whose smooth bark there stood the knife-cut inscription: “It’s where the youtth is wasted”.
</p><div id="span"><p>(….until now the literary magazine <em>The Youth</em> shocks me with the crying deficiency they spell the periodical's name with…)
</p></div><p>Then the snowfalls began, however, by the end of the day, the wide path through deep snowdrifts to the school got trodded anew. The sun sparkled blindingly on both sides of that road to knowledge transformed into a trench with orange marks of urine on its snow walls. Totally obliterated by the next snowfall, they would persistently pop up again at other spots in the restored and deepened trench-trail through the forest…
</p><p>A few weeks before the New Year, our class finished studying the primer and Seraphima Sergeevna brought us to the school library, a narrow room with one window on the second floor. There she introduced us to the librarian as accomplished readers who had the right to visit her and borrow books for our personal reading at home.
</p><p>That day, returning home with my first book, I stretched upon the big sofa and never left it but only turned from one side to the other, and from my tummy to my back, until finished the entire book which was a fairy-tale about the city with narrow streets walked by tall hammer-creatures who banged on the heads of shorter bell-creatures to make them ring. Just so a story by Aksakov about a music-playing snuff-box…
</p><p>Winter evenings were so hasty rides, you had barely had your meal and scribbled away your calligraphy home assignment when – look! – it’s already deep dusk outside the window.
</p><p>Yet, even the dark could not cancel the social life and you hurriedly put your felt boots on, and pulled warm pants over them, and got into your winter coat followed by the fur hat and – off you ran to the Gorka!
</p><p>How far away? Just around the corner! Because “the Gorka” indicated not only the two blocks as well as the whole hill but also that very tilt towards Recruit Depot Barracks which we walked down on our way to school.
</p><p>With its well-trodden snow, the Gorka served ideally for riding sleds. The start was taken from the concrete road surrounding the blocks. The deep rut left in the snow by tires of random cars confirmed that the road was still there and so did the bulbs shedding the light from their post tops.
</p><p>One of those posts marked the starting point in the Sleigh Gorka. The cone of yellow light from its bulb drew a blurred circle – the meeting place of the sledding fans crowd.
</p><p>Most of the sleds were a store purchase – with aluminum runners and multi-colored cross-plank seats. Mine was made by Dad though. It was shorter and made of steel and much speedier than those store-bought things.
</p><p>After a short run pushing the sled downhill with your hands on the backrest, you plonked with your tummy upon the seat and flew away to the foot of the hillock drowned in the dark of night pricked only with the distant lonely light above the gate of Recruit Depot Barracks that bounced in time with the leaps and jerks of your fleeting sled. And the speed wind pressed tears out of your eyes.
</p><p>When the sled came to a stop, you picked up the icy rope run through two holes in the sled’s nose and stomped back uphill. The sled tamely ran after you, now and then knocking its muzzle at the heels of your felt boots.
</p><p>And with the approach of the roadside lamp, myriads of living sparks started to wink at you from the roadside snowdrifts varying their twinkle with each step.
</p><p>Gee! Up there atop the Gorka, they already started to marshal a train of sleds, hitching them to each other and – hup-ho! – off the whole mass and wild screams and the frosty screech of  sled runners went into the darkness…
</p><p>At some point, probably, as thousands other boys both before me and after, I did something which should never be done, and we knew it all along that it was a no-no, yet the sled’s nose in the light of the bulb shimmered so beautifully with the frost-sparks that we couldn’t resist and licked it.
</p><p>Sure thing, as we knew beforehand, the tongue got stuck to the frost-gripped metal and we had to rip it off back with pain, and shame, and hope that no one noticed the folly inappropriate for so big a boy.
</p><p>Then you plodded home, dragging your sled along with stiff hands and dropped it by the basement’s door in the staircase-entrance vestibule. You climbed upstairs to the second floor and knocked at your apartment door with your felt boots, and in the hallway your Mom pulled off your mittens with a tiny bead of ice stuck to each filament of their wool, disclosing the white icicles of your hands.
</p><p>She would run out into the yard to scoop up a basinful of snow and rub your senseless hands with it, and order to put them in the saucepan in the kitchen sink under the cold water running from the tap. And life would start to slowly come back to your hands.
</p><p>You’d whine from the piercing needles of unbearable pain in your fingers, and Mom would yell at you, “Serves you right! You, rascal roamer! You, bitter woe of mine!.”
</p><p>And though still whimpering from the pain in your stiff fingers and in your tongue skinned by the savage frosty iron, you’d know for sure that everything will be fine because your Mom knew how to save you…
</p><p>After the winter holidays, Seraphima Sergeevna came to the classroom with an issue of the newspaper <em>Pioneer Pravda </em>and instead of the lesson she was reading aloud the news of Nikita Khrushchev’s promise that twenty years later Communism would be built in our country.
</p><p>Coming back home, with unrestrained delight, I shared that  in twenty years  that day we were going to live in Communism when any item at the store would be given just for asking because at school they told us so. To that news, my parents only exchanged silent glances, yet abstained from partaking in my festive mood on account of so bright a future.
</p><p>I decided not to bother them any longer, but deep in my mind started arithmetic calculations to discover that seeing the onset of Communism at seven-and-twenty, I wouldn’t be so badly old, still having some time to enjoy things free of charge...
</p><p>By that time all the pupils of our class had already become Octoberists, for which occasion a group of grown-up fifth-graders visited our classroom to pin Octoberist badges on our school uniforms.
</p><p>The badge was a small scarlet star of five tips around the yellow frame in the center out of which, as if from a medallion, peeped the angelic face of Volodya Ulyanov with long golden locks in his early childhood when playing with his sister he ordered her, “March out from under the sofa!.” And later he grew up, lost his hair and became Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and they wrote a great many books about him…
</p><p>At home, there appeared a filmstrip projector – a clumsy device with a set of lenses in its nose tube, as well as a box of small plastic barrels to keep tight dark scrolls of filmstrips.
</p><p>Among the filmstrips, there happened some old acquaintances – the one about the hero of the Civil War, Zheleznyak the Seaman, another about the little daughter of a revolutionary, who smartly hid the typesetting sorts, brought by her father for printing underground leaflets, into a jug of milk when the police raided their house late at night. They never had brains enough to check under the milk…
</p><p>Of course, it was I who loaded the filmstrips and then rotated the black scroll-wheel to move the projected frames. And I also read the inscriptions under the pictures, which did not last long though, because my sister and brother learned them by heart and retold before the whole frame would creakily creep down into the rectangular of light shed onto the wallpaper.
</p><p>The challenge to my seniority from Natasha did not hurt so bitterly as Sasha’s disobedience.
Just so recently as we two pranced, panting, into the kitchen to still our thirst with water from the tap, he readily conceded the white tin mug, adorned with the revolutionary battleship Aurora’s imprint on its side, to me as to the elder, bigger, brother.
</p><p>And emptying half of it, I generously handed the mug back for him to finish off the water, after all, that was the way for strength transmitting.
 How come that I became so strong? Because, without silly prissiness, I drank a couple of gulps from the bottle of water started by Sasha Nevelsky, the strongest boy in our class.
</p><p>My younger brother naively listened to my naive claptrap and dutifully grabbed the outstretched mug…
Like me, he was over-credulous and once at midday meal, when Dad took out from his soup plate a cartilage without meat and announced: who’d gnaw it up was to get a prize – one kilo of gingerbread, Sasha volunteered and, after protracted munching, managed to swallow the cartilage but never got the promised sweetmeat, probably Dad forgot his promise…</p>
