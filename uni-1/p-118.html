  <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">

  <p>In place of Captain Cherhykh, a Siberian, another Captain arrived to take command over Fourth Company, transferred from the Mongolian steppes.
  </p><p>He was the pleasantness itself with an exceptionally long hook of a nose reaching his upper lip constantly stretched in a gracious smile.
  When on duty, he did not keep to the Commander office but walked the barrack aisle sharing his friendly boasts about the money certificates he had brought from Mongolia, and occasionally started small wrestling matches with soldiers.
  And those matches made him so happy and agitated; his eyes began to shine, a red blush crept over his cheeks and the hanging nose began to scrape already both of his lips.
  </p><p>I couldn't get it at once although something pretty familiar flickered in his grimaces, intonations, yet what exactly I could not...Damn! I got it! The boy from Nalchik!.
  But then, well, that's an officer...Besides, there was his wife…
</p><p>In short, I dubbed him after the name of the Mongolian currency and the reasonable handle immediately took root among the soldiers of the company.
  So, at another of evening roll-calls, Tughrik once again got into how rich he was with all those certificates for tughriks, and that the first thing next day he was going with his wife to buy a new refrigerator, and a new wristwatch as well, because the one he had was just a shame and had to be thrown away, regardless of its name: "Commander's".
  </p><p>I could not stand it any longer and spoke up, "If you don't want to throw it away then give it to some soldier."
  </p><p>To which, he immediately called out, "Who said that?! Two steps out of the ranks!"
  </p><p>I stepped out. He approached me and in a demonstrative way unfastened the wristwatch strap. "Here you are!"
  </p><p>I took the watch and put it into my pocket, although he certainly expected a different outcome and had to suffer that friendly small surprise.
  </p><p>However, the next day it was me to be surprised with the hell of trouble brought about by that fucking watch.
  Half-day and no less I walked the streets attempting to sell it and no one agreed to buy. They knew if a conbatist offers you a watch it should have been pinched or at least cut off from a cold body.
  And a good watch it was, I swear, once my father paid 25 rubles in Moscow for the exact same thing, but I asked just meager 7.
</p><p>For the first time, I was not jackalling and stuff but offering a square deal...
  Nah, commerce is a dead thing if there is no demand.
  In the end, I took it to a watchmaker's, and when the mujik there suggested three rubles I just had no choice.
  </p><p>Relived, I stepped out of the workshop with the dough earned so honestly just to be confronted by an alky, "Hey, soldier! Buy a watch from me! I'll give it for just three rubles!"
  That's a coincidence for you!
  But those sots got outrageously brazen, they did not even stop at messing around with conbatists…
</p><p>A week later, Vanya told me how a <em>young </em>cook was sleeping recently in the workshop of the stoker-house.
  Being the on-duty officer that day, Tughrik stuck his long nose even to the stoker-house and saw the <em>young </em>on the mattress spread over the workbench. He clutched the soldier’s dick and stuck like shit to a shovel, "Gimme! Gimme it! "
  And now,  concluded Vanya his story, that Tughrik was already sucking two <em>young</em> cooks, while one of them was, in the intervals, fucking his wife...
</p><p>Once in the barracks, the wafflister made a try to push me around, "Seems like you think you are so great a <em>grandpa,</em> eh?"
    </p><p>I did not say a single word to it, but only protruded my lips to issue three tiny sounds, "Tchmo-tchmo-tchmo!"
  </p><p>He mutely turned around and walked away with his back stiffened at unforgiving attention.
  Since then, he dropped to notice me at all because I was such a scoundrel.
  “A naasty scoundreel!”
  </p><p>A newcomer <em>dipper</em> appeared in the company barrack who was transferred from another construction battalion somewhere in Dagestan where he went to an AWOL and caught his wife a-cheating him with another man.
  He tried to raise dust for that reason but got tied up and locked in the clink which he flooded with so convincing promises to bump off everyone involved as well as himself for a dessert, that they transferred him to us – the remotest point in the same Military District...
  The soldier was of some Caucasian origin, I can't be more exact, in Dagestan alone there were about 48 different nationalities.
</p><p>He did not talk to anyone and no one talked to him. Because of fear maybe, kinda when seeing a new beast in your native cage.
  </p><p>One evening, he sat on a stool in the aisle of the company barracks with a newspaper in his hands.
  I was passing by and some headline attracted my attention. I mean that all I wanted was just to have a look and give it back. But he replied, "Fuck off!"
</p><p>"What?! Thief-swaggering, <em>salaga?</em>"
  </p><p>He jumped up to his feet. And I never had a chance to reach him; a whole pack flew in to kick up a blizzard. The private broke away and ran out of the barrack.
  And – what's characteristic – no<em> grandpa</em> was in that pack, just only "dippers".
  Later I figured out that they were so pissed because of his making them fear him for several days; they were scared of his being not like them. No ethnic grounds though, just because of his family tragedy he harbored the danger of bumping you off and fuck the quadrangle of the circle problem. Any pack is cemented by fear...
</p><p>Yet, the buddy  ran away no farther than the Stuff barrack, he did not have the nerve to make for his native Dagestan...
  The on-duty officer came to our barrack and led me to the clink already occupied, in part, by a Dnepropetrovsk buddy kicking back around. The serviceman had some really nice grass on him and on high we went.
  </p><p>Then we lay upon the plank decking covered with some make-belief mattresses of padded jackets, and he started continuous lapping on about the whole of our great power long since being under the control of secret network of a certain shadow organization with well-developed structure of branched interaction because we all were moving toward one great goal, regardless of whether we realized that or not…
  In general, he performed much better than a company zampolit at the Sunday political classes, that kinda Knight Templar from Dnepropetrovsk delivering his profound briefing to the surrounding darkness in the clink.
</p><p>But if you were such a fucking Frank Mason how could they fucking rake you up to a construction battalion? However, I did not interfere with his structural analysis because he was the decision-making body in charge of  that quite decent grass distribution. 

  </p><p>Then the door opened and shed in some light from the bulb in the corridor while letting a droll Gingerbread Man of Tatar origin roll inside.
  Wow! Who's that with so round happy mug? Alimosha! What's brought you here, bro?.
</p><p>On the arrival of his truck to the gate, the on-duty officer suspected him of being in a state of  intoxication to some degree, the stars even intended to search Alimosha and detect a possible attempt at smuggling alcohol into detachment’s barracks.
  At that point Alimosha began to knock himself on the chest, then he unbuttoned his pea-jacket, and flung it open to demonstrate what an honest serviceman he was, and as for the smell on his breath it was not his slip at all but resulted from Zhigulovsky beer drunk accidentally, in absolute belief it was lemonade in the bottle because  it was dark in the basement where Alimosha chanced to discover it!
  That was why he was brought to join our clink conference in so immodestly unbuttoned state.
</p><p>About five minutes later, Alimosha knocked on the door and asked an on-duty <em>dipper</em> if the stars was still around.
  </p><p>Nah, gone to the Stuff barrack.
  </p><p>Then Alimosha took a bottle of wine from the sleeve of his pea-jacket and ordered to take it to Vitya Novikov in First Company because the buddies there were already waiting for it.
  The on-duty <em>dipper </em>locked us again to run the errand.
  </p><p>Then Alimosha took the second bottle from the second sleeve losing so hard and shapely biceps, after which, falling into the classic groove:
  </p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"The warriors remembered the days of their youth,<br>
  The battles they fought in by each other's side..."
</p><p>In the morning all three of us were, of course, released so that not to reduce the workforce called to fulfill the current five-year plan drawn by the Communist Party and the Government of the Soviet Union...
  As for the Caucasian with his threats of killing himself after a spree of murders in his native Dagestan, he was transferred to Separate Company…</p>
