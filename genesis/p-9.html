<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Genesis<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The second lying-in of Galina Ogoltsova occurred again outside the “box”, in the nearest, not secret district center.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…it seems that the maternity hospital, or rather, its absence was the Achilles’ heel of the then “mailboxes”…)
</p></div><p> On arrival to the maternity hospital out there, she was denied admittance because they took her for a gypsy on account of her black hair and the red dressing gown with the suspiciously garish pattern of large imprinted  flowers.
</p><p>Escorting her her husband had to emphatically condemn such an erroneous assumption, his efforts brought about change in the attitude of the segregationist nurses and they let her in for the labors at hand.
</p><p>An hour and a half later my father was told that his wife had born a girl, and five minutes later they haralded arrival of a boy baby. That's when our father issued a blissful yell, “Switch off the lamp in the deliv'ry room! The light attracts them babies!.”
</p><p>History, be it of a private person, or a developed nation, boils down to just two parts: the first one is the history immemorial, presented in loose legends, hazy myths, and dubious traditions, while the latter, on the contrary, comprises hard facts caught, tagged, logged, and anchored to a certain calendar, preserved in the public chronicles of some kind, or in the personal memory, in case of a separate individual…
</p><p>All the children of my parents were fascinated when Mom and Dad began to share the family lore about the deeds and adventures of the eager listeners at the times beyond their infant memories.
</p><p>For instance, that their first-born started his toddling at the railway station of departure from the Carpathians to the Valdai and at all the subsequent train stops my father took me out onto the station platforms to consolidate my skills in feeble walking because the wobbly floor of the rolling car did not favor such a hoopla…
</p><p>At the new place, the family was allocated a wooden house from which I was allowed to go for independent walks in the yard bounded with a fence of slender planks. My mother was greatly perplexed by my coming back from the yard always as dirty as a piglet. Where could I possibly find any dirt in so tiny and orderly enclosure?
 Changing my dress once again, she asked my father to trace back to the reason.</p><p> So he watched as the kid let out in the yard immediately takes  the direct route toward the fence plank fixed with just the upper nail, pushes it aside and – off he goes! In  the street the boy busily climbs the hillock of sand dumped for the construction of another house nearby. Atop, he plops on his tummy
to slide all the way down the slope of sand drenched by the recent rains. And keeps laughing so happy along his ride too! Could you manage washing for such a villain?.
</p><p>While my mother was changing my dress over again, my father took a hammer, went out and nailed the dangling plank in place. Then he came back and together with my mother watched: now what?
</p><p>The kid went out into the yard up to the usual place and pushed the plank. It didn’t stir. Neither did the planks on both sides of it.
 The corralled child went along the fence, twice, trying each of the planks then he stopped and burst into tears….
</p><p>My memory retained neither that house nor its yard, but at this point in the parents’ narration, I had to suppress the empathic tears welling up in my eyes. Poor boy!
</p><p>And with another legend, the soft paw of horror bristled up my hair before piercing  the back of my neck with its point-sharp talons; when my mother  grew suddenly anxious that I had not been around for quite a stretch already, and she sent my father to look for me.
</p><p>He went into the yard then into the street – not a sight of me anywhere, neither any of neighbors had seen me and it was already getting dark.
</p><p>Dad walked the street again, from one end to the other, and then he paid attention to the rumbling noise of the river. He hurried to the steep, almost vertical, slope under which the river, swollen after the rains, rolled angrily on.
And there, far down, he made out his son. Run, Daddy, run!.
</p><p>The torrent of muddy water had engulfed the narrow strip of the bank under the cliff-like drop-off. He had to race knee-deep in the water.
</p><p>The boy clenched to the wall of clay holding on a tuft of withered grass in his pinch, with his feet in the rushing torrent. He did not even cry already and only whimpered, “uhu-uhu..”
</p><p>Dad wrapped him in his jacket and hardly managed to find a spot he could climb out without helping himself with his both hands…
</p><p>And how proudly fluttered the wings of my nose at the story that it was me to give names to my brother and sister!
</p><p>Since I was named after my father’s brother, the names of my mother’s siblings were readied for the twins who came next. In the maternity hospital, they were addressed just so – Vadik and Lyudochka.
</p><p>However, when the babies were brought home and the parents asked me what we would call them, I immediately replied: “Sassa - Tattassa.” And no fast-talk could convince me to change my mind.
</p><p>That’s how my brother became “Alexander” and my sister was called “Natalia”.
