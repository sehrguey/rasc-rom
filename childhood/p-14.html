<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The hardest thing in the morning was getting out of bed. It seemed you'd give anything at all for another couple of minutes lying undisturbed by their yells it was time to go to the kindergarten.
</p><p>On one of such mornings, the pillow turned out to be so yielding under my head, and the mattress spread over the folding bed had developed such an exact mold of my body that a mere thought of tearing myself away from their pleasant warmth accumulated overnight under the blanket was simply unthinkable.
</p><p>So I went on lying until there popped up the frightening knowledge – if I would not shed off that blissful boggy drowsiness right away, then never would I come to the kindergarten that morning, and never ever come to anywhere else because it would be a languor death in sleep.
</p><p>Of course, so macabre words were then beyond my ken, I didn’t need them though nor other extravagant expressions of that kind because my thoughts were coming mostly in the form of feeling, so I just felt freaked out, got up into the chilly room and started to dress.
</p><p>On Sundays, it was possible to lie as long as you wanted but never again the bed acquired such a pleasing shape…
</p><p>One Sunday I woke up alone in the room and heard Sasha-and-Natasha’s merry screams from somewhere outside. I donned and hurried out into the corridor.
 They were not there nor in the kitchen, where only Grandma was clinking the pots’ lids.
</p><p>Aha! In the parents’ room! I ran in there at the height of fun – my brother and sister, and Mom was laughing together at a white shapeless lump standing in the corner on their bare feet.
Of course, it’s Dad! He had covered himself with the thick blanket from the parents’ bed and now awkwardly loomed there next to the wardrobe.
</p><p>But suddenly those legs started to jump together, fluttering the fat white folds of that horrible bare-legged lump. It blocked the way towards the corridor for Mom and all three of us, clutching at her dressing gown.
</p><p>Oh, how we laughed! And clung to Mom more and more convulsively.
 </p><p>Then one of us began to cry and Mom said, “There-there, this is Dad, silly!” But Sasha did not stop (or maybe Natasha but not me though my laughter was more and more transforming into hysterics) and Mom said, “Well, enough, Kolya!”
</p><p>And the blanket straightened up revealing laughing Dad in his underpants and tank top, and we all together began to console Sasha sitting high in Mom’s arms and incredulously trying to laugh through tears.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…laughter and fear go hand in hand and there is nothing more frightening than some unmakeoutable thing…)
</p></div><p>And on Monday morning I went to the parents’ room to admit that at night I again peed in the bed.
</p><p>They were already dressed, and Dad said, “Gak! Such a big boy!”
And Mom ordered me to peel off my underpants and get into their bed. From a shelf in the wardrobe, she fetched dry underpants for me and followed Dad into the kitchen.
</p><p>I lay down under the blanket still warm with their warmth. Even the sheet was so soft, caressing.
Full of pleasure I stretched out as much as I could, both legs and arms.
</p><p>My right hand went under the pillow and pulled out an incomprehensible hardened rag. I could not determine its purpose in their bed but I felt that I touched something shameful and shouldn’t ask anyone about it…
</p><p>It’s hard to say what was more delicious – Mom’s pastry or Grandma’s buns both baked for holidays in the blue electric oven “Kharkov”.
</p><p>Grandma Martha spent her days in the kitchen cooking and washing up, and in the children’s room sitting on her bed not to be in the way of our playing.
</p><p>In the evenings, she read us The Russian Epic Tales, a book about hero warriors who fought the countless hordes of invaders or the Dragon Gorynich, and for the rest and recreation after the battles, they visited Prince Vladimir the Red Sun in the city of Kiev.
</p><p>That’s when the iron bed had to bear the additional weight of the three of us seated around Grandma Martha to listen about the exploits of Alesha Popovich or Dobrinya Nikitich.
</p><p>When the heroes had their moments of sadness, they remembered their mothers, each one his own, but to their different, absent, mothers they all addressed one and the same reproach: why those mothers weren’t smart enough to wrap the future heroes into a piece of white cloth while they  were still just silly babies and drop them into the fast running River-Mommy?
</p><p>Only Ilya of Murom and Warrior Svyatogor, who grew so mighty that even Mother the Earth could bear him no more and only mountain rocks still somehow withstood his movements, never raised that lamentation, not even when having the bluest blues…
</p><p>At times one or another of the hero warriors had a fight with one or another beauty disguised in armor. Those fights ended differently but the defeated would invariably say, “Do not kill me but treat instead to good food and drink and kiss on my mouth as sweet as sugar.”
</p><p>With all of those epic tales heard more than once, I knew by heart when such combats with gastronomic outcome were near at hand and eagerly anticipated them in advance.
</p><p>Grandma Martha named the bathroom “a bathhouse”, and after her weekly bath, she was returning to our room steam-heated to red and half undressed, in only a tank top for menswear and one of her long skirts. Then she sat down on her iron bed to cool off while combing and braiding her gray hair into a pigtail.
On her left forearm, there was a large mole in the form of a female nipple, the so-called “bitch’s udder”.
</p><p>In course of one of her after-bath proceedings when she seemed to notice nothing but the curved plastic comb running through the damp strands of her hair, I took advantage of my brother-and-sister being busy with their play on the big sofa and sneaked under the iron net of the Grandma’s bed sagging under her weight.
</p><p>There I cautiously turned over to my back and looked up – under the skirt between her straddled legs put wide and firmly on the floor.
</p><p>Why? I did not know. Neither was there anything to make out in the dusk within the dark dome of the skirt. And I crawled away, as carefully as I could, filled in the aftermath with shame, regret, and a strong suspicion that she was aware of my hushed maneuvers…
</p><p>Sasha was a reliable younger brother – credulous and taciturn. He was born after the brisk Natasha, with his complexion turned startlingly blueish because of the umbilical cord had almost strangled him, yet he was born in a shirt, which was taken off him in the maternity hospital because according to Mom's explanation they were producing some special medicine from newborns’ shirts.
</p><p>And Natasha turned out a really shrewd weasel.
She was the first to know all the news: that the next day Grandma would bake buns, that new tenants were to move into the flat on the first floor, that on Saturday the parents would go to a party at some people’s place, and that you must not kill a frog or it would rain cats and dogs.
</p><p>At the sides of the back of her head, there started two pigtails reaching her shoulders both intertwined from halfway down  with inlaid ribbons to fix each of the braid ends with a lovely bow-knot.
</p><p>Yet, neither of those bows could stay in place for long and fell apart into a tight knot with a pair of narrow ribbon tails. Probably, because of zealous spinning her head on all the quarters to find out: what-where-when?.
</p><p>The two-year difference in age gave me a tangible degree of authority in the eyes of the younger.
 However, when Sasha taciturnly reproduced my climbing up to the attic, then by that feat he, like, overtook me for two years.
</p><p>Of course, neither he, nor I, nor Natasha was capable at that time to put into words such a finicky deduction. We stayed at the level of emotional sensations expressed with interjections like, “Wow, boy!..” or, “Oh-oh, boy!..”</p>
