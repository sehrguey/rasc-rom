<div id="span"></p><p>(…every road, when you pass it for the first time, seems endlessly long because you cannot measure yet the passed part of it against what is still ahead. When passing the same road again and again, it obviously shortens.
</p><p>That keeps true with the school academic year as well. But I’d never discover it had I left the race at the beginning of the second year at school…)
</p></div><p>It was a clear autumn day and our class went on the excursion to collect fallen leaves. Instead of Seraphima Sergeevna, who was absent that day, we were supervised by the School Pioneer Leader.
</p><p>First, she led us through the forest, then down the street towards the Detachment Library which we didn’t reach but turned into a short lane between the wooden houses, that ended atop a steep slope bridged with two wide flights of board stairs streaming straight down to a real football field bound by a wide cinder path.
</p><p>Following the flights, we descended to the large plank landing in both directions from which, there ran half-dozen bleachers made of timber beams.
</p><p>No bleachers were seen on the field’s opposite side but only a lonely white hut and a tall stand with the huge picture of two footballers fixed motionless forever at the zenith of their jump high up in the air at the moment of frenzied scramble for the ball with their feet.
</p><p>The girls of our class stayed back collecting the leaves from between the bleachers, while the boys bypassed the football field along the cinder path behind the goal on the right and fled down the dip to the river running nearby.
</p><p>When I reached the riverbank, three or four of the boys with their pants rolled up to the knees were already wading the hurried stream that noisily rushed through the gap in the broken dam while the most of classmates stayed on the bank just watching.
</p><p>Without a moment’s deliberation, I pulled off my boots and socks and rolled the pants up. Entering the water was a little scary – what if it’s too cold? But it turned out quite tolerable.
</p><p>The angrily roaring stream pushed with a constant drive at my legs below the knees, yet the river bottom felt pleasantly smooth and even. One of the boys wading in the splashing ripples next to me shouted through the gurgling roar that it was a slab from the destroyed dam – wow! so classy!.
</p><p>And so I waded hither-thither, caring not to drench the upturned pants when everything—the splashes of the running river, the eager yells of classmates, and the clear gentle day—all at once vanished. Instead, on all sides, there was a completely different, silent, world filled with nothing but oppressive yellowish dusk and trickles of pallid bubbles waltzing up before my eyes. Still not realizing what had happened, I waved my hands, or rather they did it on their own accord, and soon I broke free to the surface full of blinding sun glare, and the ramble of rushing water that kept slapping my nose and cheeks with choking splashes, clogging distant split yells: “he drowns!”
</p><p>My hands flip-flapped at random in the stream until the fingers grabbed the end of someone’s belt thrown from the edge of the slab so meanly cut-off under the water.
</p><p>I was dragged out, helped to squeeze the water out of my clothes, and directed to a wide trail bypassing the whole stadium so as not to ran into the School Pioneer Leader and peachy girls collecting fallen leaves for their autumn herbariums…
</p><p>In a bird’s-eye view, the school building, supposedly, looked like a wide angular “U” with the entrance in the center of the underbelly.
After the lobby tiled with brown ceramic, two corridors of parquet flooring with slippery glint led to the opposite wings of the building, the  horns of the “U” from the bird’s point of view.
</p><p>Along one wall in each of the corridors, there ran a row of wide windows looking into the area enclosed in between  the horns and filled with a jumbled thicket of young, husk-like-skinned, pines. The wall opposite the windows had only doors set far apart from each other, marked with numbers and letters of the grades studying behind them.
</p><p>The same layout continued after the turn into the left wing, yet in the right one, there was the school gymnasium taking up the whole width and height of the two-story building. The spacey hall was equipped with a vault followed by the thick cable of spirally twined strands hanging from the hook in the ceiling and the parallel bars next to the pile of black mats by the distant blind wall. And near the entrance, there was a small stage hiding behind its dark-blue curtain an upright piano and a stock of triple seats stacked up there until needed for the gym transformation into the assembly hall.
</p><p>The upper floor was climbed up the stair-flights starting at the turn of the left corridor into the horn-wing, and the layout up there replicated that of the first floor, except for the lobby, of course, with its nickel-plated stand-hangers for school kids’ hats and coats behind low barriers, each with its own wicket, on both sides from the entrance door. That’s why the second-floor corridors ran straight and smooth between the wide windows in one wall and the doors of classrooms in the other.
</p><p>Attending school in felt boots, you could take a short run and skid along the slick parquet flooring, if only there were not black rubber galoshes on your boots neither a teacher in the corridor. My felt boots, at first, savagely chafed my legs behind the knees, then Dad slashed them a little with his shoemaker’s knife. He knew how to do anything.
</p><p>In winter you came to school still in the dark. Sometimes I wandered around empty classrooms. In the seventh grade’s room, I peeked inside the small white bust of Comrade Kirov on the windowsill. It looked much like the insides of the porcelain puppy statuette in the parents’ room, only dustier.
</p><p>Another time, switching on the light in the eighth grade, I saw a wax apple left behind on the teacher’s desk. Of course, I fully realized that it was not natural, yet the fruit looked so inviting, juicy, and as if glowing with some inner light that all that made me bite the hard unyielding wax, leaving dents from my teeth on its tasteless side. Immediately, I felt ashamed of being hooked with a bright fake. Yet, who saw it? Quietly turned I the light off and sneaked out into the corridor.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…twenty-five years later, in the school of the Karabakh village of Noragyuogh, I saw exactly the same wax imitation, with the imprint of a child’s bite and smiled knowingly – I saw you, kid!..)
</p></div><p>Kids of all nations and ages are much alike, take, for instance, their love for Hide-and-seek…
 That game we played not only in the Courtyard but at home as well, after all, we were a company of three and sometimes more numerous with the participating neighbor children – the Zimins and the Savkins who lived at the same landing.
</p><p>Our apartment was not abundant in hiding places. Well, firstly, under the parents' bed, or then... behind the cupboard corner... er... O, yes! – the cloth wardrobe in the hallway.
</p><p>My Dad made it himself. A vertical two-meter-tall bar planted off the hallway corner, with two metal rods connecting its top to the walls, cut out a sizable parallelepiped of space. Now, it just remained to hang a cloth curtain on ringlets running along the horizontal rods and cover the whole contraption with a piece of plywood so that the dust did not collect inside. The do-it-yourself cloakroom at ready!
</p><p>On the paint-coated wall inside the cotton-walled vault, there was fixed a wide board with pegs for hanging coats and other things, the big brown wicker chest stood on the floor beneath the hanger-board, and there still remained a lot of room for the footwear…
</p><p>Sure, the hiding places were pretty scanty, yet playing the game was interesting all the same. You holed up in one of the enumerated spots and, keeping your breath under the strenuous control, listened to the “it’s” cautious steps before off you rushed to be first at the big sofa in the children’s room from where the “it” started their search, and assert your win by tap-tapping on the big sofa’s armrest and the loud yell, “knock-knock! that’s for me!”, so as not to be the “it” in the following round of Hide-and-seek.
</p><p>Yet, one day Sasha managed to hide so successfully that I couldn’t find him, he just disappeared! I even checked both the bathroom and the storeroom in the hallway, although we had a standing agreement to never hide in there. And I felt through each of the coats on the hanger-board behind the cloth curtain in the hallway.
</p><p>Then I opened the wardrobe in the parents’ room with Mom’s dresses and Dad’s jackets hanging in the dark warm compartment behind the door that bore the big outside mirror.
</p><p>Just in case, I checked even behind the wardrobe’s right door  though there was no room for hiding in the compartment filled with the drawers for stacks of sheets and pillowcases, except for the one below where I once discovered the blue square of seaman’s collar cut off a sailor’s shirt. And, wrapped into it, there was a dagger of a naval officer with spiral ribs in the yellow hilt and the long steel body tapering to the needle-sharp point hiding in the  taut black scabbard. A couple of days later, I couldn’t keep the temptation back and shared the great secret with the younger ones. However, Natasha casually shrugged the news away and answered that she knew about the dagger all along and even showed it to Sasha…
</p><p>And now Natasha with happy giggles was following my vain search and after the frantic cry addressed to our absent brother that, okay, I agreed to be the “it” one more time and let him go out from wherever he was now, Natasha also yelled instructing him to sit tight and quiet, and not to give up.
</p><p>I ran out of patience completely and refused to play anymore, but she suggested that I leave the room for a  moment. Returning from the corridor, I saw Sasha in the middle of the room pleased and silent, and blinking bemusedly at Natasha’s report how he climbed the fourth drawer in the wardrobe where she piled socks over him…</p>
