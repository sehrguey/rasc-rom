<div id="span">
  <p>  The same feel of dissolving and turning into a part of everything else around when you cannot say where your “I” ends and shifts into “not-me”, I've lived through once again and much later, in Karabakh already.
 Only that time it was I who watched, and it happened in summer instead of winter.
</p><p>Even though telling this story is the outright violation of the linear flow of narrative in breach of the  canon of classical time-place-action unity, yet, after all, it is my letter and it’s my life, and why not to give turns to my liking?
    </p><p>So…)
    </p></div><p>In Stepanakert, I am not to be seen a day or two before my birthday and about as long after it because for that period I enjoy the freedom of hiking.
    </p><div id="span"><p>(…see? Being born in summer is a quite advantageous quality…)
    </p></div><p>My local relatives have already ceased to be surprised or get angry. They concluded that it’s an old, odd but firmly established, Ukrainian tradition – to go away for your birthday and just walk following a random look of your eyes.
  And so it was in August (I don’t remember the exact year) end nineties’. Yes, no later, because of this here tent was bought in the last year of the last millennium.
</p><p>That August I went north through the woods over <em>toombs</em> where there were no villages but the views of enthralling beauty. Exactly as in the age-old warning by Mom, “You’ll be there alone.”
    </p><p>After a day-long climbing up to ascend a <em>toomb</em>-ridge where the woods got replaced with the alpine meadows, I came across some soot-black pieces of slate and a bunch of charred poles. Apparently, before the war shepherds were coming there with their flocks, and they brought the construction materials to build a hovel.
    </p><p>And who burned it? Well, you never know… Might be got hit by the lightning as well… Anyway, nothing of my business.
    </p><p>So, I passed and went on, higher, and in a saddle bridging two <em>toombs</em> I discovered an ancient tomb.
    </p><p>How did I guess at its antiquity? An easy question...
   It was excavated, unearthed by scavengers greedy for a buried treasure who left a hole in the ground and four to five roughly-hewn stone slabs, half-ton each. People weren’t buried that way under socialism, nor in the capitalist epoch. The nearby ridges were not rocky so the slabs had to be transported from afar. But what for?
 </p><p>Well, one look around would remove the question – What a sweep of incredible beauty! The sky without any limit, the placid wavy chines of <em>toomb</em>-chains all around, the distant ones covered with dark woods, and those nearby with Alpine meadows.
 </p><p>Now, bringing the slabs from as far as I could not suppose where would call for a plum sum of money, or real power, or both. Which made more than enough of clues for an unbeatable guess – it was one of the Karabakh <em>melique</em>-princes who one day rode out hunting, reached that place and fell in love with it, and didn’t want to get parted from it even after his demise. The only nagging flaw in his calculations: the greed of ashes desecraters was not taken into account.
 </p><p>See? No historical enigma can escape its ultimate solution when we apply to it our tall tales in the absence of any opponent…
    </p><p>I passed over to the next <em>toomb</em> and on its summit got under the rain. Not a big deal though, because for such occasions, I’ve got a thoroughly worked-out and pretty practical technique.
    </p><p>So, as usual, I took off all of my clothes, packed them into a cellophane bag and started dancing in the altogether under the downpour. Those dances, actually, were never meant as some pagan ritual, they're intended to keep me warm; in the mountains up there without the sun and under the rain it’s really chilly, let me assure you. Yet, probably, there still is a certain paganist admixture, otherwise how to account for all those  strident wild   yells to accompany the nude dances? Anyway, solitude does have certain advantages – you’re not likely to be arrested for the violation of public order.
    </p><p>With the rain over, I rub-dry myself with the sweater and put on the dry clothes from the bag, ain’t I a smart guy?
    </p><p>But that time after one rain there came another, and my second dancing was not so enthusiastic as the first one.
    </p><p>The additional rain also let up after all, and I prepared to stay overnight in a shallow hollow to hide from the cold night wind.
    </p><p>About midnight the drops of one more rain tap-tapped on my sleeping bag and made me realize that I was kaput. A raging stream of rainwater ran down the hollow, I struggled out of the sleeping bag put it on my back and stood with my legs wide apart giving way to the running spate. That’s when I guessed that my sleepover spot was just a gulch, but I could not leave it either because of the squally wind joining the fun. There was nothing to do but wait for the dawn in the posture of the  letter Z, clutching my knees with my hands, under the sleeping bag on my back, drenched through and through, and the rivulet running between my feet. The uncontrollable inside shudder mingled with the lashing by outside chilly rains, which that night I lost count of…
    </p><p>The morning started through a thick mist, yet with no rain, except for drizzling, and the wind also began to abate.
    </p><p>Jerking like an epileptic, I squeezed the water out of my clothes and the sleeping bag, as much as my cold-stiffened hands could manage to.
 I had not the slightest desire to go any farther; hearth and home were all I craved for. So, I went back, yet even walking did not warm me up, I was too busy being trembling all the time.
    </p><p>Normally, going downhill is easier than going uphill, but for me that difference, for some reason, was gone and at times I was sort of floating, while to the hearths of civilization there still remained at least a day of normal walking. That’s when I remembered the slate – it was much closer if only I could find it. It’s somewhere along the edge of the wood. For which reason, down that<em> toomb</em>, I was descending in zigzags so as not miss the slate pieces in the tall grass.
    </p><p>And I did find the place.
    </p><p>Seized with the sticky shivering tremor on the one hand and overwhelming stiffness on the other, I started to restore the shed and the work warmed me better than walking...
   The thing I accomplished looked like a crude tent of fire-smeared slate pieces. Inside, it was tall enough for sitting on the ground and more than enough for stretching for the whole body length.
 </p><p>Then I built the fire at the entrance with the wreckage of poles and deadwood which I dragged from the nearby coppice. I warmed my sides by the fire and began to dry up the sleeping bag. When the color of its fabric turned lighter and stopped issuing any steam, I believed in the probable  survival.
    </p><p>All next day the sun was glaring blindingly, but I had a slanted roof of slates over my head supported with the charred poles walked by the soundless lizards as lazy as I was, because in all that day I went out just once – to collect an armful of grass and spread it under the sleeping bag on the ground...
    </p><p>And so it went on, day after day, without any changes, if not for the growing company – cautious mice joined me and the lizards. They did not dare to step over the fire ashes, so I left a piece of baked potato outside, but the rest, together with bread and cheese, hung in the haversack up the rafter poles under the slate.
    </p><p>At nights, the full moon rose to fill the world with clear-cut shadows.
   On one of those well-illuminated nights, I went out to take a leak, and on the way through the tall grass, from under my feet there burst  a brood of quail with the loud flutter of wings and shrill outcry, “Damn sleepwalker! Watch your step! We’re sleeping here!” As if they did not scare me stiff!
    </p><p>In the light of day, over the wide expanse of the valleys, the vultures glided without ever moving their wings. Watching them from the depths of valleys you turn your face up to see their circling so high above, but now, laying on my sleeping bag, I didn’t even have to stick my head out of the slate tent.
    </p><p>When one of them trespassed the invisible borderline between their hunting grounds, the skylord soared higher and, folding his wings, fell down upon the brazen prowler like a stone. I heard the whistling sound of the air cut by his dive next to the slate tent entrance. He missed, however, or maybe was not keen on hitting but only wanted to warn and shoo off the sneaking bastard. All of us are blood kin, after all.
    </p><p>And so it went on…
    </p><p>All my business was to roll over from one side to the other, from the belly to the back, having no desires, neither ambitions nor plans.
   Sometimes, I was falling asleep with no regard to the time of day, because it made no difference…
 </p><p>Well, and I also watched, of course. I watched how beautiful and perfect the world is...<br>
     Sometimes I think, maybe the purpose of man’s existence is just seeing this beauty and perfection. Man is merely a mirror for the world to look into, otherwise, it would not know its own beauty…
   </p><p>Six days later, I returned to civilization, just for the sake of righteousness.
   </p><p>On coming back, to all the questions I responded in quite a laconic way because my vocal cords, after being idle for so long, became too lazy and I could only speak in a hoarse whisper.
    </p><div id="span"><p>(…all I want to say is that both times—in that winter forest and among the summer<em> toombs</em>—I had the same feeling that I was not alone and someone else was watching that ski-riding kid and the supine lazybones in the shade of burned slate pieces and, more strangely, I was a part of that someone and watched myself from the twilight of the winter forest and from the tall grass on the <em>toomb</em> slope because we all are involved…
    </p><p>Well, on the whole, some weird stuff, a folly accomplished…)
    </p></div><p>With the spring at hand, we, the fourth-graders, started active preparation for the admittance into the ranks of young pioneers, for which purpose we copied and memorized the Solemn Oath of Young Leninists.
    </p><p>One day after the break, Seraphima Sergeevna entered the classroom with an unknown woman. She introduced her as the new School Pioneer Leader and said that we were going to have a Leninist Lesson and had to go out into the corridor and keep very quiet there because the other classes were at their regular lessons.
    </p><p>We went out into the long corridor on the second floor, where along its walls with the windows on the left and the rare doors to the classrooms on the right, there hung different pictures with differently-aged Lenin in all of them…
    </p><p>The new School Pioneer Leader commenced from the very beginning. Here, he’s quite a young man, a youth, actually, after getting the news about the execution of his elder brother Alexander by the Czarist regime, he consoles his mother with the words “We’ll go another way”, which is the name of this famous picture, by the way.
    </p><p>And our class followed her quietly to the next poster with his photograph in the group of comrades from the underground committee…
    </p><p>The working silence reigned in school, we passed by the closed doors of the classrooms with the school children sitting behind them and only we, like secret conspirators, veered from the usual course of the school regime and seemed to have joined the life of underground, following the quiet voice directing us from a picture to a picture…
    </p><p>Then the spring came, and again the thawed patches appeared on the slope between Block and Recruit Depot Barracks but I wasn’t checking them anymore…
   One sunny day coming home from school, I took over an unfamiliar girl of my age. Maybe, from the parallel fourth grade. I get ahead of her and looked back at the face full of absolute lack of care about my walking along.
 </p><p>The brag just asked for a small demonstration that I was a boy of consequence in the surrounding whereabouts. And besides, I had a gang of my own, like Robin Hood, the noble robber.
    </p><p>Still walking on, I half-turned to the left and told with eloquent gestures to the Bugorok-Knoll beyond the decaying skating rink, “Hey! Don’t be so careless! Duck!! Don’t let them spot you!”
 So, if the snooty girl looked that way, no one would be seen there…
</p><p>Another time, with the snow, completely gone, I was going the same route and squinting because if you squint without closing your eyes completely, but only to the point when the eyelashes from your upper and lower eyelids meet and touch each other, you’d see the world as if through the transparent wings of a dragonfly. That way I was not, actually, walking but flying in a tiny dragonfly-like helicopter and watching through its Plexiglas roof which I saw in <em>The Funny Pictures</em> because even though I was past the preschool age I still turned pages of that magazine for small kids if I come across it.
    </p><p>And then I remembered how rebellious Kotovsky, in the movie “Kotovsky” at the Regiment Club, answered the arrogant landlord, “I am Kotovsky!” After which he grabbed him and threw through the window panes of the landlord’s house.
    </p><p>So I also grabbed the rich scoundrel by the breast of his jacket and threw him into the roadside ditch. And I proudly called myself with the glorious name, “I am Kotovsky!”
    </p><p>Yay! And I liked to be so strong. That’s why I replayed the episode several times walking uphill to Block. And why not? Who was to see me along the empty road?
    </p><p>At home, Mom told how she and Paulinna Zimin had a hearty laugh watching through the neighbor’s window my grabs and throws of nobody knew who.
    </p><p>But I never confessed that I was Kotovsky at the moment…</p>
