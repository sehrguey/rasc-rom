<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> Defying the Wash<br>&nbsp;</h3>

     <p>
My relations with the fellow shut-ins were even and correct, as anywhere else, I staunchly stayed an undeclared renegade.
Naturally, those derailed out of reach and submerged  into the vagaries of their private worlds, did not notice me, while shut-ins capable of thinking, as far as possible, showed certain respect caused by the sympathy and compassion for my exposure to the insulin injections.
Only one young guy, Podrez, for some time was fawning over me without any reason but then, in the queue to the dining room, he hit me in the stomach, I couldn't guess why.
</p><p>Two minutes later, Beltyukov, in the same queue, found some  fault with Podrez, pinioned him and kept immobilized.
He did not say me anything, not even with his eyes, but there was no need for hinting that  Podrez was fixed by him for me to jab the guy into any spot at my discretion.
But I did not hit, I feel sorry for the mentally ill, notwithstanding my hurt stomach.
</p><p>A far more terrible blow dealt me the loss of the book in English.
On the white desk in our wardroom, there remained only the copybook with the since long finished translation and the pen stuck in between its pages.
I was upset unbearably because the book was borrowed from Zhomnir, who had borrowed it from another teacher at the Department of English – the ever-smiling Nona.
But when I, in that terrified state, turned to the head doctor, she, with the indefinite indifference, responded that the book would not go anywhere.
</p><p>And she was right.
Three days later it was returned to me by a shut-in who collected it from the nutty kidnapper at Wardroom 7, he failed to keep it concealed any longer.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...I understand the thief's sentiment.
At those times they did not know in the Soviet Union how to produce such glossy paperbacks for books, and all of a sudden—wow!—a gaudy close-up of a female face against the background of the fifth unit.
Who would resist?..)
</p></div><p>He did not spoil it in any way, and only the backside of the cover bore light touches of a pencil by which he tenderly poured out his adoration, slightly reminiscent of a sketch of the cerebral cortex, or whimsy curls of whirling smoke.
It even might have been some formulas of the unknown scientific language from beyond the future, only that I have  given up already moving down that road…
</p><p>The shut-ins were all so very different.
At first sight of some of them, you could immediately see they had a yo-yo stream of consciousness if any at all, but with some other, you’d hardly say he's nuts.
</p><p>In general, there were all kinds of sorts, with quite neighborly types among them, like that brunette fat man.
However, one day, lying on the hospital couch in the hall, he confessed to me his murder of someone else and, usually so very cheerful, he grew at once all gloomy.
Maybe it was a lie because the murderers were kept at the second unit whose paramedics were  brutes accomplished…
</p><p>Yes, there happened incurable liars around.
One of them, with a fat tattoo of "Kolya" on his hand, without any invitation started convincing me that his name was Peter, and after that, he took an obvious offense at me although I had not expressed any doubts.
</p><p>As for Tsyba, he amazed me with his erudition because he enumerated the unsuccessful suicide attempts by Hemingway until he found out that a pistol was the most steadfast means for the purpose. And before that, I listed him among the unmistakable half-nuts...
</p><p>There was a  seemingly normal gaffer, whose queerness you could guess only from his sentimentality, he got devastatingly hurt hearing that we all lived in a madhouse.
Always. For life. The madhouse through and through, both indoors and outside, no difference.
</p><p>"Do not say so, at least here it's a mental hospital."
</p><p>Such a delicate soul…
</p><p>Or, say, that mujik whom I for a long stretch considered dumb.
On the contrary, he was very inquisitive, it's just that he prepared his questions all too carefully.
It took him a month before he approached me and, eye to eye, asked about the sorest spot, "And your wife, was she a chaste virgin?"
</p><p>Firstly, no dumb have such words in their lexicon and, secondly, I hadn't checked her ears, quoting Rabentus.
</p><p>And the dumb, on hearing that, began to cry. He fell silent again  dripping noiseless tears.
</p><p>A rather gloomy madhouse on the whole…
</p><p>However crazy, the shut-ins knew everything, and four days beforehand they warned me that on Friday I would be called to the commission where they decide to set me free or go on with their treatment.
The commission consisted of the head physician of the psychiatric hospital, the head doctor of the fifth unit and the on-duty nurse.
Afraid of saying something wrong, I was amenably falling over myself to agree with anyone, grovelling even before the nurse, "Yes, yes, of course, yes!"
</p><p>The head doctor said they had prepared me for discharge, but I would only be released if some of my relatives come to pick me off.
</p><p>How afraid I was that no one would come on Saturday! After all, there had been such a Saturday when I waited in vain.
The whole evening after the commission I had to restrain myself so as not to burst into tears. Sobs literally clenched my throat – I would not stand another week of injections…
</p><p>My parents came together, and from the landing by the door, we were summoned to the office of the head doctor who said that my treatment should be continued with iminazine pills.
</p><p>My mother thanked her so very much, and my father took out the money from his jacket pocket and handed it to my mother. She came up to the head doctor and put the money into the pocket of her professional white  smock, but the head doctor did not even notice it.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...as I learnt later, the amount was forty rubles – the combined daily earnings of a team of six bricklayers.
That day there were three discharges, so the head doctor earned my monthly payment in one morning.
</p><p>As they say in Konotop, it depends on what you've been trained for...)
</p></div><p>On the bus from Romny to Konotop, my mother cautiously informed me that my things had been moved from the apartment rented under the great birch tree, back to  Decemberists 13.
Though saddened by that news, I had not strength to resist…
</p><p>At first, our team met me guardedly as a person returning from Romny.
However, at  construction sites, such attitude wears out quickly enough, if by the end of a working day you neither surprised anyone with your shovel over their head nor took a dive from the fifth floor then you're like everyone else.
</p><p>True, Lydda noticed that I leaned against the pallet with bricks and dozed off in the sun, while the crane was fetching the mortar up, which previously never happened to me.
And Gregory commented to Grinya that I was not the same, and pointed at the spanner  laid by me over the niche for the electric meters on the landing: one edge five centimeters higher than the other.
</p><p>Grinya answered that they would lap it up all the same because the niche was to be screened behind the frame around the box for the meters.
</p><p>So I had to put the spanner to rights during the midday break, but before Romny I wouldn't have allowed me such a slip.
</p><p>And, in general, I became more compliant. The only thing that the treatment couldn't straighten out, was my ill will at falling on all four when laying from the bridging slabs the load-wall on which they rested.
Everyone did it on their all four, it's more convenient that way, and safer too. Yet, I still just hunkered when laying the brick course at levels lower my feet, in disregard of protests by the weight center.
Vitta also at times refrained from kneeling.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...sometimes, it’s an up-hill job to get rid of the young pioneer inside you.
</p><p>"Better to dive from the fourth-floor height than lay the wall standing on your knees!"..)
</p></div><p>When I went to Nezhin for a weekend, I took pains to keep my eyes a little squinted, otherwise, people felt creepy at my shell-shocked sight because my lower eyelids drooped as if I'd been forced to watch a documentary series about the death camps, gas chambers, and grim crematoria...
I recollected the long article about Clockwork Orange in the monthly <em>Moscow</em> read in the stoker-house at the construction battalion, about how they applied the same technique to him...
</p><p>Noticing a double chin that started to form under my jaw, I threw the glass container with iminazine pills (the generous gift from the fifth unit head doctor) into the drain pit in the garden at  Decemberists 13.
The next day my mother spotted it there and threatened that she would report to psychiatrist Tarasenko my violation of directions from Romny.
</p><p>"Mom, how can't you see it? Their pills are just a means to make me crazy."
</p><p> I did not want to lose my leanness, which I always pride myself in, notwithstanding its slight stoop... </p>
