<p class="centered2 ital bold">
  "And the drill grounds will start shining,<br>
  Will get polished with our boots,<br>
  Will be milled to fractions tiny<br>
  By the  marching brave recruits..."
</p><p class="centered3">(to the air of "Take the harness, guys, off your horses...")
</p><p>  At the Draft Collection and Distribution Point in the regional center, I made a desperate  attempt at getting exempted from the army service.
During the final medical check, I reported to the oculist that  I couldn't see with my left eye any deeper than the second line in his check chart on the wall, although, in fact, I saw three. For that, slightly exaggerated deficiency, I was recognized  fit for non-combat service in the construction troops.
</p><p>After three days of kicking back upon bare-timber decking at Collection and Distribution Points and equally hard shelves in the railway cars for draftees, I stood in the rank of draftees on a platform at the Stavropol railway station in only one shoe. Unlike the Perseus' case, my right foot was not bare but wearing a cotton black sock.
  </p><p>And what else could I do?
  Early in the morning when they commanded all to leave the car, I searched not only the section where I slept but a couple of neighboring ones as well under mad yells of the sergeant from the car exit. My right shoe was not found and feeling through the sock fabric the wet and chilly asphalt  of the station platform  recently drenched by the night rain, I followed how a fuzzy suspicion at the back of my mind was gradually  acquiring  more definite delineation that the disappearance of my footwear item   came to pass by dint of the vindictive hand of Valik Nazarenko from the Krolevets city.
</p><p>Of all the guys in our car section, only he had a thick pack of postcards, and at each stop, he begged the people passing along the platform outside the car to drop a bunch of filled out postcards to a mailbox. Who would deny a young boy being taken away even though not in a prison, yet also in a securely locked railway car?
</p><p>And after our train left the station, Valik would put on a canny countenance and ask himself his invariable question, "Who else to write to?" And then  he answered to himself, "Ah! I know!", and started to fill another postcard or two that he was going to serve in the army and had already passed the city of Rostov. And finally, he read his literary production out loud for all the present in our car section.
  </p><p>All of his writings were alike and ended with an inevitable, "My best wishes, Valik".
 On the second day, I suggested him to vary the word order—at least in some postcards, for a change—to make it, "My Valik wishes best". All laughed then, but he laughs best who laughs last, and standing on the platform in a soaked sock, I did not feel like laughing at all.
 The kickback to my innocent pun left me without a shoe which, most likely, never arrived in the city of Stavropol but stayed way back,  mateless, strange and foreign to the rank grass of the embankment... To a whimsy play on words, the redhead bastard reacted with the rude practical joke. However, who's not caught at action is not the joker...
</p><p>We were told to get into the backs of waiting trucks, that drove us through an unknown, not yet awaken, city, then left it as well as the highway going out of it and took left turn along a worn-out asphalt road that after three more kilometers reached a long white-brick wall about meter-and-half in height.
</p><p>The trucks drove into the open gate of vertical 2-inch thick iron pipes by the checkpoint guardhouse whose glazed red tablet disclosing that it was the Military-Construction Unit 11, aka the Military Detachment 41769, while the road left outside the gate went on to the nearby horizon…
  </p><p>We were lead to the bathhouse, before which they asked us whether anyone was going to send his clothes back home. Quire predictably, no one entertained any such plans because, according to the old tradition, draftees were leaving for the service in their junk clothes which were eventually dropped on the grass around the bathhouse porch.
  </p><p>Only in the canteen at the Rostov Collection and Distribution Point, I saw a draftee in his suit and necktie.
  He fell out of the picture with his age too – about ten years older than the surrounding skinhead yobbos, however, he was not twenty-seven yet, otherwise, they wouldn't draft him.
  And his hair wasn't cut.
  He ate nothing, just sat without a motion staring in front of him, or rather looking inward.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...because it's only from outside that we all look the same, while inside there is a hell of a lot to consider, the epics unfolding in there are way cooler than the Illyad coupled with the Odyssey...)
</p></div><p>There he sat in a tie loosened on his thick neck, paying no notice to neither sympathetic nor sarcastic ogles, not knowing what was ahead where they were taking him…
</p><p>In the Military-Construction Unit 11, shortened to VSO-11, there was all necessary minimums for keeping lots of humans in one place.
</p><p>A close group of five long barracks paneled with painted plywood sheets inside and overlaid without with white bricks laid in shiner position, squatted behind the white brick fence along the roadside.
 The barracks were connected with the common system of steam-heating pipes running up in the air on tall iron props. For heat insulation, the pipes were wrapped in glass wool, fixed with white glass cloth, and covered with the finishing layer of black roofing felt kept in place by twists of thin baling wire.
</p><p>Three of the barracks to the right from the gate  were lined along the brick wall separating the military territory from the road outside, each of them surrounded by an internal asphalt path.
 Across the path behind the leftmost barrack, there stood a wider, but also one-story, building comprising the Canteen with its kitchen, and the Club of the detachment.
</p><p>In the third row, counting from the road, there was the stoker-house, the bathhouse, the shoe-making and sewing shops under one common roof for all.
</p><p>The drill grounds under the rough layer of concrete, started   from the gate and stretched on to the Canteen.
 Opposite the Canteen, across the drill grounds, there stood the last two barracks of the five, parallel to each other and the wall along the outside road. Behind them, next to the far left corner of the drill grounds, there stood a brick toilet, aka <em>sorteer</em>, accomplished with ten holes, aka <em>ochcos</em>, in the concrete slab alongside one wall and the cemented urinal runnel along all the opposite one.
</p><p>To the left from the <em>sorteer</em>, there stretched a ten-meter tin trough of a washbasin raised by meter-tall rebar props above the ground. The water pipe with a dozen taps ran along over the trough.
  </p><p>Farther on, behind the drill grounds, there stood three tall truck boxes in a raw, each one without the face wall and – to their left – two rows of sturdy sheds of ware and food warehouses.
 Behind the warehouses, a bit on the outskirts of the detachment rectangular grounds, stood the squat structure of the pigsty.
</p><p>Ah, yes! The last but not least – the narrow brick hut of the military store by the gate, opposite the checkpoint guardhouse...
  </p><p>The narrow white wall of bricks stood only along the asphalt road, and the rest of the perimeter was guarded by the fence of barbed wire, so familiar from the early childhood.
  </p><p>Behind the truck boxes and the barbed wire fence, a wide field rose hiding in the invisible hollow a deserted sandpit and the village of Tatarka, which was visited by the soldiers of VSO-11 at their AWOL's, aka absences without leave.
  </p><p>As for the road by which we were brought to the detachment, it entered, after another six kilometers, the village of Demino, where the soldiers also went for AWOL's to, as well as to the city of Stavropol, sure thing.
  </p><p>But all that I hadn't known yet  leaving the bathhouse in the cotton khaki outfit and high kirza boots on top of badly wound footcloths – two strips of light coarse calico or flannel fabric, 30 cm. x 60 cm., which are much more practical than common socks.
  </p><p>In summer, when baring your feet you'll notice the dirty stains left by the dust that got through the socks' fabric, while the footcloths, however dirty they become themselves, still keep your feet clean. Only they should be wound properly around the feet—tight and smooth, without wrinkles—otherwise, you'd rub your feet to bleeding.
  </p><p>And in winter, footcloths without socks feel warmer than footcloths over socks, though both methods do not save toes from getting frozen inside the boots…
  </p><p>Two soldiers from the previous drafts were poking through the civilian clothes dropped on the grass in front of the bathhouse, checking whether there were any <em>citizenka</em> items suitable for AWOL's...
  </p><p>We were led to the detachment Club fitted out with a bare stage without any curtains, and rows of plywood seats lined across the hall over its tilted floor of not painted timber. There our service started with dragging the audience seats out of the Club, washing the wide floorboards, bringing and installing iron bunk beds for the Fourth Company personnel to sleep upon, since we, the recruits, were to be kept in their barrack.
