      <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Birchbark Sketches<br>&nbsp;</h3>
     <p> <br>…Varanda…<br>
      …a handful of random sounds…
      <br> …some sonorant nothing… as any other name…
    </p><p>And the river itself, at this distance, is nothing but a discordant growl of water in endless headlong run, tumbling among them those solid boulders littered to block the path, whaling away at their blunt pates or, maybe, temples, but only breaks in thrashes against their listless hugeness into the spits of futile frenzy, sends forth the gobs of splashy froth, and rolls in  unremitting helter-skelter on and on, and on, without ever getting away from the trap of here and now, fixed in unchanging impetuous rush from nowhere to nowhere, under hollow seldom taps, not to time nor in key, from the smooth ground gravel in its riverbed…
    </p><p>And the duration of the fit? Don't hesitate to call it infinity plus this one day.
         Nations had risen and past away, to quote the glorious sage Abu-Lala  lecturing his string of camels, while this river kept rolling here and still has to, like in all those ages upon eons since before the beginning of time.
       </p><p>Mountain rivers tend to keep changeless, except for their names. Sure bet, the hunters of the Stone Age  earmarked this one by other sounds than its present sobriquet because all flow and everything changes, handles are not exempted. And with the innumerable multitude of roamers the river's seen upon its banks, you can't decide who’s runnier: the dateless stream of the Varanda or all kinds of us. Now, here am I, a casual bum from endless series, neither the first nor the last by its omnipresent flow.
       </p><p>...profound pleasure, bro, from your extremely lacy wordwork...and how about pinning down this “I” of mine, eh?...
       </p><p>A minor spill, considerably dehydrated and motionless for a while, spanned over the good ol’ hole through which all of the future tumbles away into the past; a relay-pipeline from a snotty noddy kid to an old, flea-bitten curmudgeon, the only common thing they share is this ubiquitous word of “I”.
       </p><p>...me too, me too!...don't leave me out!...I’m also somewhere in between them those two, on our non-stop journey from the one to the other, for even though a-sitting on the Varanda’s bank I still go with the flow...
       </p><p><figure class="centered2 bold ital">“ O, water! We be of one blood!</figure>
        </p><p>…whoa, man! what are you up at? playing a freaking smartie?...who cares a flick about your fizzing quotations at this time of the day?.
     </p><p> The lazy time remains the most uncaring of all, it dozed off about my one-person tent. The twilight  outside its shabby nylon wall still has a long way to creep on before transforming into the dark of night.
     </p><p>…right, then why not to whittle away the snoozer with something useful, eh?.
     </p><p>…say, composing the letter promised to your daughter…how about that?..we’ve got the promises to keep, remember?.
     </p><p>…especially with not a sliver of a chance to fall asleep so early...
     </p><p>…just only watch your mouth, pardner… easy with them those f-f..er..fumbling quotations…
     </p><p class="centered2  ital"><br>Hello, Liliana
      </p><div id="span"><p>(…a hugely nicer name than “Varanda”, eh?...
      </p><p>…shut up and mind your business!.)</div>
      </p><p>Seems, I do start,  at last, the letter promised when we met in Kiev.
      </p><p>What for? To marshal a bunch of self-excuses and belated explanations to claim not guilty and absolve my impeccable self?
  Anything can be explained; nothing can be redone. Yet, with the word given, I've got to keep it…
</p><p>Real hard it was to stomach your exemplary correctness and overemphasized use of the officially plural “You”  to keep me at a proper distance: “Sure, Sehrguey Nikolayevich…” “Exactly, Sehrguey Nikolayevich…”
       I began to resent my own patronymic, yet faced the flogging without a flinch, as fits a manly man.
     </p><p>Saying “Daddy” to a stranger come upon in the Internet vistas is pretty difficult, moreover, if he looks nothing like the Mr. Pretty Guy sitting in your Mom’s album...
      Some obscure mujik with a hanging gray beard… Not a grain of Daddy from your dreams who you’ve missed since your early childhood. You dreamt of that Daddy, not of this old man. No, thanks!
    </p><p>Accordingly, our farewell hug at the railway station was just put up with (not a big deal for a woman nearing thirties) and that’s it. The inveterate ice stayed rock hard all along, no microscopic crevice cracked its cold surface; the gardens didn’t splash in bloom, neither got filled with lively chipper chirps of blackbirds, thrushes, tits, and starlings to mingle their joyous trill with the triumphant blare of The Happy End fanfares.
   The stranger who failed to become anything but a stranger let you go and I gave the promise of a letter to you. Thus we parted, two strangers, at the Kiev Main Railway Station…
 </p><p>However, of the two of us, I'm better off because there have been so much more of you in my life than me in yours.
 </p><p>I can still recollect your kick at my nose as you turned over within your mother’s belly. Or that thick sterile cocoon that I carried from the maternity hospital with you calmly sleeping inside.
 Up to this day, watching with my mind’s eye how in the string of your kindergarten chums  you walk round the Xmas tree  warms my heart. The most beautiful kid was you, with the fair smooth hair, in a silk quilted vest, red pantyhose, and tiny  high felt boots of black.
</p><p>I remember quiet Sundays at the empty playgrounds of another kindergarten in the neighborhood, forlorn and empty on days-off where we were coming for you to take a ride on the swing pended with two iron rods. At swaying, the swing screeches pierced the somnolent silence about the playgrounds strewn with the fallen leaves. Those shrieks, alike to sorrowful gull howls, ripped my soul apart. Because I was nothing but a weekend Daddy.
</p><p>On weekdays I was far away, working, like a dog, a mule, a slave, at Construction Train 615, aka SMP-615, on various building sites in the neighbor region to earn by self-sacrificing labor an apartment for our young family, and have a home, sweet home for us…
</p><p>Then there arrived that weekend doomsnight when, in the narrow bedroom divvied up by your grandparents from  their three-room apartment to start our family, I was lying next to my dearly loved wife on the hand-me-down double bed and got  crushed with the road roller of her story.
</p><p>A couple of days before the weekend, a friend of hers gave my wife a pleasure ride on his Volga GAZ-24, driving miles beyond the city limit, to the Hare Pines Forest by the Moscow highway which he left and parked among the trees. From the glove compartment, he took a bottle of champagne and stripped its foiled cork in the soft demi-light from the dashboard, under a mellow tune on the radio in it.
      She sipped a bit and sadly said, “Please, take me home.” And he obediently started the motor…
      </p><p>The whispered briefing on my wife’s unswerving chastity dried up, replaced with deafening silence.
      </p><p>Stretched on my back, I was spreadeagled by the avalanche of mutely toppling walls and through their suffocating mass only your innocent breathing still somehow reached me  from your cot in the corner. The air got strangely liquid leaving  oily stale aftertaste. Severe mighty grip squeezed my heart and, to withstand the pressure, it turned into a hard flintstone.
      </p><p>The only good news was the grimy, pitch-black, darkness, kind enough to hide the odd cold teardrop that rolled out of the corner of my eye and crept, soundless and slow, down my temple to get lost among the hair roots...The last tear in my life...Later on, its trail was followed by wrinkles digging across the temple skin but never again no other tear left my eye in any direction. Except for the tears wrung out by high winds but those do not count.
      </p><div id="span"><p>(…back to your vapid drool, sissy wuss?...of topple-tumbled lumps of hopes trampling the poor wimp against the anvil of his own heart petrified in good time, safe and proper, eh?...
      </p><p>...be a man, buddy, and seek solace in simple truths, whose simplicity makes them so peerlessly unrivaled in their inevitable surety...
      </p><p>...no busting your balls at construction sites, no sunburns or frostbites will remove or postpone the upcoming next time, when she won’t say, “Let’s don’t,” and start instead to catch the trick of having it in the environs of the GAZ-24 interior...
      </p><p>...and here another truth undisputed because of its simplicity for  you  – the recollection of past delights can’t fetch the joy back, but let a speck of mopish memory flit by and the pain, suppressed and gone ages ago, pops up afresh to bite you...
      </p><p>...it makes you wince even here, by the unknown river running through the middle of nowhere, thousands of kilometers away from the crumpled bedroom, after millions of instances of passing the ubiquitous relay baton of “I” from one I on to the next one…
      </p><p>...I tell you what, my dear I...heal yourself with the same dog’s hair...got bitten by a simple truth, eh?...bust it with as simple a tool!...crack it with the wedge of a wider grammatical approach, procede from “I” to “we”...
      </p><p>...who are we after all?...some shaved and powdered, or greasy, shaggy, bristly (or whatever else dictates the current fashion trend) cartload of trained primates…
      </p><p>...a member cannot but live by the group’s rules and no tricks will ever get you off the hook...ignorance of a law serves no excuse, not a chance to dodge its application to you, right?…
      </p><p>...now then, comfort yourself with this simple truth, wipe your mawkish
slobber up and wait; maybe it’ll dissolve that nasty clutch on your balls core...
      </p><p>…oh, shut up, man!...the like stuff is not for female tender  ears...hmm…
      </p><p>…seems, like, I’d better give it a start over…)
