<p>Back at the field camp, they called us into the trailer with a long table for the midday meal. Such a dinner does not fall under the name of <em>havvage,</em> it was some real cheerful chow.
The cook in his camouflaged with layers of grease, but otherwise white, jacket splashed half-dipper of sore cream into a huge enamel bowl and filled it over with red steaming borshch. A big piece of boiled meat was put on top.
After emptying my bowl, I got filled to the brim.
</p><p>Then the cook served golden balls of young potatoes fried with dill covered by meat sauce.
Absolutely delicious, but having no room for the second course, I finished it off only for principle's sake.
</p><p>The compote seemed a glut excess, yet I managed to poured it, gradually, in.
</p><p>With thanks for the treat, I rose and very carefully went down the steps of the front porch. When on the ground, I unbuckled my belt and with the gait of walking dividers proceeded to the garden adjoining the field.
There I neatly laid me down on an armful of dry hay under an apple tree, in the hope that maybe I somehow would not explode.
</p><p>And so it happened! By the time the blonde came into the garden, I felt normal.
She sat under the same apple tree, leaned her back on the trunk and smiled at me her sweet inviting smile.
</p><p>I was amazed by the exact coincidence in the scenic design – a garden around her and me beneath the apple tree, and only the serpent was skipping the picture.
And with tender emotion, I started to think of Eera and pride myself for keeping staunchly true to her. Because I abstained from falling in the usual groove  and going along with the flow despite all too ingratiating conditions  for the purpose – the bed of hay in the apple-tree shade in the Garden of Eden conveniently attached with the blonde…
</p><p>The next morning saw me, and the chief engineer, and a long tape measure marking out the projected walls of two inspection holes in the boxes under  construction. Tshombe did find what to keep us busy with...
</p><p>A couple of days before the completion of the term at the construction platoon, Sasha Chalov popped up at the Auto-Depot 4 on no particular purpose, just to drink the sun in the tumbler.
Giving a tender jerk to his briefcase he, as was his custom, recited his favorite quatrain:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">" One won't sound at all<br>
And two won't jingle this way<br>
When people of such quality<br>
Live in the Soviet land!"
</p><p>From the poetry standpoint, the piece sucked more than absolutely, yet in the same breath, conveyed an optimistic message inspiring and bright.
The stoker-"chemists” helped to sort out with the contents of the portfolio, which made one bottle for a snout and soon after the consumption, Sasha Chalov left.
</p><p>It was already late, so Tomato and Yura also steered to their stoker-house but, on the way, they knocked on the door of the girls' room. It happened to be locked.
They knocked again and then, carried away with the recollections of their happy school days and themselves – adolescent hooligans – they started cutting capers around the locked door.
Some paper slips were lit to burn and shoved in the gap under the door. The girls defended themselves from inside with the water from their kettle.
</p><p>In the background was I, stretched out on my bed, producing a soundtrack of hue and cry. A sudden rage against the whole female tribe broke out in me, like, because of them all was so boring and awry  that I myself did not know what I needed. So, I lay there yelling the most disgusting things.
</p><p>Were the door open from the very beginning, the "chemists" would simply come in and go out, but now they were burning with hunting ardor. Under the sword of Damocles of getting sent back to Zona, they surely had no intention of jeopardizing their state, they were just having fun.
</p><p>However, the poor girls in the besieged room were not up to all these logical operations or seeing any fun at all, when a pair of convicts were attacking their door, under my instigating, idiotic, yells from the common bedroom, "Bitches! Wolf whores!"
Finally, one of the guys from their Phys-Math course approached my bed and said that it was not right. I shouted to the stokers that that was enough, and Tomato with Yura faded in the woodwork right away, the "chemists" had no problems about logic.
</p><p>Next morning I knocked on the door of the girls' room. It was not locked.
I entered and apologized for the previous night. "Afraid of expulsion from the institute?" asked the one with the brown hair.
</p><p>Hardly would she believe that I was just ashamed. Even less, could I bring it over to her that I did not know whether I was afraid or wanted to be sent down...
</p><div id="span"><p>(...looking back brings not too much fun because of frequent temptation to spit in your own face.
However, the truth remains true only when it's unvarnished, and all that shit is also me...)
</p></div><p>Since I earned some kopecks at the student construction platoon, I bought a doll for Lenochka. Of course, I wouldn't be smart enough to do it, but the All-Union radio station "Mayak" for at least thrice a day aired the most popular hit of season:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"Daddy, present me,<br>
Daddy, present me,<br>
Daddy, present me<br>
With a doll!."
</p><p>And during a day that hit would get you someplace or another and  start to spin on and on in your brains even without the radio around until – click! – hey, that's an idea!
So I went to the Department Store after a doll, but there were no dolls.
</p><p>It wouldn't be right to always blame the era of shortages. It's not any era's fault if good ideas   pop  up in the mind of some dolt when it's late...
So I had no other choice but to buy a dog of the biggest available size with the price answering the proportions. The brute was no less than a meter tall, rigged out with trousers and a shirt. The same, practically, doll, only with a canine head…
</p><p>Lenochka grew a healthy child, and she attended the big kindergarten "Sunny" not too far from home, in the apple orchard alongside May Day Street.
All September, I was taking her to "Sunny" and coming after her at the end of the day, because those who worked at the student construction platoon were exempt from the patronage assistance to collective farms.
</p><p>My beard was shaved off but I kept the hair long.
Once I and my brother went to dances together. Sasha Basha had already replaced The Spitzes at the Loony dance-floor.
</p><p>My brother had served his two-year hitch at the Baikonur cosmodrome and because of that he lost any chance of going out of the country for twenty years.
Even visiting the resorts of socialist Bulgaria was out of the question to make sure he wouldn't blurb out to a chance CIA spy sunbathing on a beach that at the Baikonur, besides the astronauts, all kinds of test ballistic missiles were launched every week...
</p><p>Starting off to the Loony, I put my "mona-Lisa" sunglasses on.
You’d hardly need to wear sunglasses in the evening, but the "mona-Lisa" in its thin golden rim was commonly viewed as the swanky symbol of a dandy dude of fashion as well as the jeans losing their blue dye  with wear.
Such jeans were pushed over for 120-150 rubles, which was more than an average workman salary. The mainstream trafficking  of jeans  to Konotop was operated by well-tanned Algerians who studied at the Engineering Technical School on Peace Avenue.
</p><p>By the by, those Algerians were so naive. "He said-a come-a go out and talk-a. I come-a out, he kick-a me a kick. Why-a?"
But for all their naivety, they never scaled the jeans price down.
</p><p>And my jeans were worth just merely 30 rubles and that what they looked, some Brazilian crap never fading with washing, nothing like Lyalka's "Levi's".
Therefore, although it's hard to see through sunglasses in the evening, they justified themselves on the dance-floor, veiling the misery in jeans...
</p><p>To the dance-floor, my brother and I arrived after the break when the crowd crammed the place to the utmost.
Sasha went around looking for his girlfriend, and I pulled up nigh the stage and remained there listening; Basha's guitarist, Marik, was good at solo breaks.
</p><p>Then some <em>salabon</em> buster came up and gazed at me. Well, quite understandable too, he got impressed with such a hippy-long hair, the "mona-Lisa", and my metropolitan air in general.
So, he stared for a while and got lost in the crowd.
</p><p>I stood where I was and in a couple of minutes–good evening to your <em>khutta!</em>–the same buster popped up but already with his buddy.
They approached me and, synchronously so, swayed back and–lo!–two fists were flying at me.
I parried them with my shoulder but the collective impact of the double blow slammed me off and I, like, flew into some parallel space.
</p><p>I mean it – it was a completely different dimension, as if under the sea.
The sound of the dances instantly turned off and I was gliding or, rather, spinning along the concrete floor. From all the sides in that mute space around, lots of legs rushed towards me, each one all too eager to kick. And those legs were somehow not complete but, sort of, cutouts, from feet and up to knees, no higher.
So they whizzed by from here and there, only soundlessly, yet missed kicking.
</p><p>I yanked me up and jumped onto the bench by the circular grating and pressed my back to its pipes. That’s when the sound came back, the shrieks of girls and Basha's preaching on the microphone, "Friends, please, observe..."
And round the bench, a pack of guys stood facing me and one of them, such a hefty slob, yelled, "Who're you? Who're you? Take off your glasses!."
</p><p>I pulled the "mona-Lisa" off and someone shouted, "From The Orpheuses!"
They obviously were Settlement guys although I did not even know them.
</p><p>So, they yanked me off the bench into their tight circle and warped out of the dance-floor, and they  at once went back to the general sorting out in progress.
On that day the blades from Depot Street attempted at staking off the Loony as their sovereign turf.
</p><p>At the park exit, I met my brother with his brow  broken. We had to go to the Station for him to wash the blood off under the tap in the men's room…</p>
