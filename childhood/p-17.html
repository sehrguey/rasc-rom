<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>I have no idea what at that tender age made me so certain that they inevitably would write books about me.
</p><p>Yet, the conviction was not without a sprinkle of shame scorching my cheeks at the thought that future writers when touching my childhood years would have to admit that even being a big boy,  a first-grader already, I sometimes peed in bed at night, although Dad just couldn’t hold back his exasperation because at my age he no longer made puddles in his bed. Never!
</p><p>Or take that terrible occurrence when on the way from school my tummy got squeezed by unbearable colic which made me run home to the toilet room, but there everything stopped halfway, in spite of all my straining, until Grandma, terrified with my heartrending howls, rushed from the kitchen to the toilet and, snatching a piece of newspaper from the bag on the wall, ripped the stubborn turd out.
</p><p>Who would ever dare to write such things in a book?!..
</p><div id="span"><p>(…already in another—my present—life the current wife of mine, Sahtic, went to a fortune teller in the war-destroyed city of Shushi when our son Ahshaut fled the local army because of harassment by his company commander and regular beating up at the guardhouse.
</p><p>In the year of Ahshaut’s birth, the USSR was ripping apart at all seams, some new life was promising to start, instilling hope that before he grew of age there would be no army drafts but only contract enrollment of volunteers.
And why not? “You never know the Devils’ next joke,” quoting a Russian byword.
</p><p>Well, in my dream’s case, the son of a bitch was not in the mood for joking.
</p><p>The commander of the company, handled Chana, picked on Ahshaut because of his own dissatisfaction with the unfair arrangement of life – after the Karabakh war his combat bros became generals with hanging stomachs and personal Jeeps equipped with drivers while he, Chana, was still rotting at the front line.
</p><p>After Ahshaut was missing for eight days, Sahtic went to Shushi, to the popular fortune-teller who assured her that everything would be alright.
</p><p>And so it happened.
Ahshaut came home, we took him back to the place of his service, to the commanders of higher rank than Chana, and he was transferred to another regiment, in a hotter spot, where he served the remaining year, though already without the sergeant stripes in his shoulder straps…
</p><p>So then, in the process of seeing the future, the seer shared additional information, kinda the bonus for turning to her for help, that my Grandma, though in the other world already, was ill at ease about me and lighting a candle up here for her sake should pacify the worries.
</p><p>My Grandma’s name (so the fortune teller) was almost like that of Maria, only a little different...
</p><p>I was simply flabbergasted with the accuracy of the extrasensory guess. Maria and Martha are indeed very similar names of the two sisters from the Gospel. Leo Taxil says that even Jesus Himself sometimes confused the chicks…
</p><p>And when my Grandma was ninety-eight, she also started to forget her own name. On such days she saught her daughter’s help, “Lyaksandra, I keep wondering lately – what could my name be?”
</p><p>Well, Aunt Alexandra was also a good one, “Oy, Mom! But I can't recollect either! May it be, Anyuta?”
</p><p>“No … Somehow different it was…”
</p><p>And three days later she would triumphantly announce to her daughter, “I remembered! Martha, I am. Martha!.”
</p><p>No wonder the fortune teller couldn’t deliver her exact name…
</p><p>However, by this flashforward, I jumped ahead way too much because it’s me who had to serve in the army first, but in this here letter to you, I’m still at the kindergarten senior group.
</p><p>I think I’d better turn off the tap with profound thoughts on infantile megalomania, and return to the period when the kindergarten was completing its share in the formation of my personality…)
</p></div><p>Now, back to the pivotal 1961…
 What is remarkable about it (besides my graduating the senior group at the Object’s kindergarten)?
</p><p>Well, firstly, whichever way you somersault this figure it'll still remain “1961”.
</p><p>Additionally, in April  the bell-like voice of Levitan cut off the usual flow of programs from the radio on the wall of our room to chime out that in an hour there would be read an important government declaration. Grandma started sighing and stealthily crossing herself.
</p><p>However, at the appointed time when all of the family gathered in the children’s room, Levitan gleefully announced the first manned spaceflight by our countryman Yuri Gagarin who in 108 minutes flew about the globe and opened a new era in the history of mankind.
</p><p>In Moscow and other big-time cities of the Soviet Union, people walked the streets in an unplanned demonstration, straight from their workplaces, in robes and overalls, some carrying large paper sheets of handmade placards: “We are the first! Hooray!”
</p><p>And at the Object in our children’s room filled with bravura marches of orchestras from the radio on the wall, Dad was impatiently driving it home to Mom and Grandma, “Well, and what’s there not clear?! They put him on a rocket and he flew around!”
</p><p>The special plane with Yuri Gagarin on board was nearing Moscow and, on the way, he got promoted from Lieutenant straight to Major. That’s why at the airport, he descended the airplane stairs with big stars already in the shoulder straps of his light-gray officer’s greatcoat to march with proper parade step along the carpet runner stretched from the plane to the government in raincoats and hats.
</p><p>The laces of his polished shoes somehow untied on the way and whipped the carpet runner at each stomping step but he did not lose his demeanor and in the general jubilation no one even noticed them.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…many years later watching the footage of the familiar newsreel, I suddenly saw them though before that as, probably, all other viewers, I could only stare at his face and the well-trained marching in.
</p><p>Did he notice himself? I don’t know.
</p><p>But all the same, he came up so confidently and, holding his hand under the peak of his forage cap reported that the mission assigned by the Party and the Government had been successfully accomplished…)
</p></div><p>Standing under the wall radio at the Object, I had a fairly faint idea about bestriding a rocket in its flight, but if Dad said so, then that was the way to open a new era…
</p><p>A month or two later there came the monetary reform. Instead of being large and long pieces of paper, the rubles shrunk considerably, yet kopecks remained the same. The mentioned as well as less obvious details of the reform became the standing subject in frequent agitated discussions of adults in the kitchen.
</p><p>In an effort to join the world of grown-ups, at one of such debates, I stood up in the middle of the kitchen and proclaimed that those new one-ruble bills were disgustingly yellow and Lenin in them did not look like Lenin at all but like some petty deuce.
</p><p>Dad threw a brief glance at the couple of neighbors participating in the discourse and told me not to meddle in conversations of elders and right away go to the children’s room.
</p><p>I bore the offense silently and left. But if Grandma could say whatever she wanted, why wasn’t I also qualified to?. Especially, that at times I heard Mom praising me at her chit-chat with the neighbor women, “He happens to ask questions that even I have no answer to!”
</p><p>From those words, I felt proud tingling up inside the nose as after a hearty gulp of lemonade or fizzy water.
</p> <div id="span"><p>(…what if my megalomania took roots right there?
</p><p>However, the setback at the exchange on the new money served me a good lesson – no plagiarizing from your grandma, be kind to present the wits of your own, if only there are any…
</p><p>And, by the way, about the nose.
</p><p>When visiting homes of other people, be it a neighboring apartment or, say, in separate houses, like that of Dad’s friend Zatseppin, there was felt some kind of smell. Not necessarily rasncid, yet always there, and it was different from place to place. Only at our home, there was no smack whatsoever…
</p></div><p>In the summer of 1961, the adults of the Gorka blocks took great interest in volleyball... After her work and home chores, Mom put on her sportswear and went out to the volleyball grounds, at a stone’s throw across the road, alongside the Bugorok-Knoll that looked like one of the hills in The Russian Epic Tales.
</p><p>The games were played by the “knock-out system” with the teams replacing one another till the velvety night darkness condensed around the yellowish bulb up on the lonely log post nearby the volleyball grounds. The players chided each other for failures or hotly lambasted the opposite team’s protestations, but no one dared to argue with the umpire because he sat so high and blew the whistle.
</p><p>The on-lookers also rotated. They came and went, shouted along with the game, manned teams of their own, slapped themselves to kill a biting mosquito or paddled the buzzing scourges away with green broad-leaved branches.
</p><p>And I was there and also fed the mosquitoes, yet they are just a dim recollection while I remember dearly the rare feel of communion and belonging – all around were us and we were our very own people. Such a pity that some of us had to leave and go, but–look!–there were others coming. Ours. We.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…so long ago was all that.
</p><p>Before the TV and the WIFI split us up and shoved into separate cells…)</p></div>
