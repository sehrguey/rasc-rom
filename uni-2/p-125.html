 <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part two)<br>&nbsp;</h3>
 <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">

 <p>I was matriculated at the English Department, but the triumphant departure to Konotop was somewhat clouded by having words with the commandant of the hostel who found a shortage of one pane in the window of my room. The glass had not been in place when I moved in there, but the jackass did not listen to my  explanations, demanding retribution in ready money, or finding a workman who would insert the pane.
 Besides not having the specified amount,  I resented the unjust rip-off. When left alone in the room, I went up to the upper floor and pulled a glass from the window in the toilet. The pane size fitted perfectly,  I do love the standardization!
 The commandant still croaked that the glass had obviously been in use and I proclaimed that it was bought at a chance seller in Bazaar, at which transaction I missed to notice those paint smudges along the edges.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...our old good world is very repetitive, at any rate, my arguments when dealing  with commandants are all alike...)
</p></div><p>Olga resisted the very idea of my striving for higher education, moreover in the field of pedagogy. As for English, she did not consider it a specialty at all because everyone should know the language nowadays, so she was told by a baby doctor who visited to treat Lenochka's cold.
 I responded by calling the doctor smart dumb-ass and swore to come to Konotop on every Saturday.
 Yet, Olga stopped pecking at me only after I agreed that she would dye my hair with hydrogen peroxide. That's why in the all-out picture of the 1975 first-year students at the English Department of the Nezhin State Pedagogical Institute, aka the NGPI, I had looks of the fancy ass-hole of protagonist in <em>The Hero of Our Times</em>–a blond with the dark mustache…
 </p><p>Our course was divided into four groups of twelve students each, with only one male per group. The exactly same male-female ratio was maintained at all the other courses of the English Department.
 </p><p>Because of my obviously dyed hair, some local young fairy started trailing and coveting me with signs of care and close attention along with insistent proposals to make friends that were full of wooing intonations like those by the boy from Nalchik.
 After a shock sample of construction battalion parlance, he bleated that his life was ruined for he had missed his chance of going to Moscow because of me, and pissed off.
 </p><p>Olga immediately informed me that in Nezhin I was hanging out with fags.
 On my demand to specify the source of the fabrication, she mentioned a certain Shoorik whose sister studied at the Physics and Mathematics Department of the NGPI.
</p><p>At my request, Lyalka called Shoorik out of the Loony dance-floor into a dark alley where I allegedly wanted to have a talk with him.
 I hit the summoned Shoorik on the jaw and he did a runner with all deliberate speed. I didn't pursue though and only shouted after him in the traditions of construction battalion, "Come here,  fucker!"
 Rather a strange way to lure back a runaway, if you come to think of it…
</p><p>The classes in the Old Building lasted from nine to almost three and then I went along the wide asphalt path towards the sandstone-tiled New Building in front of which there stretched a row of thick sprawling willows screening under their canopies straight benches without backrest...
 In thirty meters from the New Building's left corner, there loomed the red-brick five-story block of the student hostel, aka the Hosty, and alongside if, after another thirty meters, there stood the canteen, a tall two-story Mausoleum-like structure styled as a couple of glazed cubes.
</p><p>The large hall on the second floor contained a crowd of square, four-person, tables wrapped in the hum and babel of students' voices, of water wooshing in the dishwasher’s, snaps of kitchen utensils, clicks of plates with chosen <em>havvage</em> landing on the plastic trays, which were dragged over narrow railing along the kitchen counter towards the woman in the stiff tube of white cloth upon her head behind the cash register in the end of the rail-path.
</p><p>With a fleeting glance at the tray contents, the nun of the order of Starched Cashiers announced the verdict—from 60 kop. to 1 ruble—accepted the payment, gave the change, and her box spat out anther paper slip onto the heap of the neglected checks...
 At times some students, with a quirk for research, took the same set of food while in different places of the moving line – just so, from purely scientific curiosity.
 The payment for those control sets varied. The cashier created the price on the fly, by the inspiration  prompted by the client's looks, the outside weather conditions, and the level of noise in the hall...
</p><p>After finishing their meal, guests went to the first floor, past the shortest embodiment of human wisdom E = mc<sup>2</sup>, painted on the wall of the staircase landing.
 As runs a Russian proverb, the empty stomach rejects all learning, while after the meal the theory of relativity might seem more attractive, you never can tell.
</p><div id="span"><p>(....by the by, it's a moot point who's wiser – Einstein or the guy who found such a fitting place for the application of the genius’ formula...)
</p></div><p>On the first floor, there was the constantly locked hall of celebrations that hosted a couple of weddings per year.
 Going out onto the high porch you could still turn into a glass door of a small confectionery with two saleswomen in nun whites, and the usual assortment of sand cakes for 22 kop., two-day-old donuts, and tobacco products.
 Cigarettes were not too good, rather on a dampish side, except for "Belomor-Canal" of the most excellent quality – stuffed with dry and finely chopped tobacco, which is very important.
</p><p>Once, being on high, I demanded from the saleswomen "The Ledger of Complaints and Proposals", which presence was the must in any Soviet store, and scribbled thanks on the Belomor account, concluding it "be blessed, dearest dears!"
 A graphomanic would always find a vent for his hidden passion...
 </p><p>Now you could return to the five-storied Hosty.
 Three columns of wide-section iron pipes paint-coated in the tonality of medium rust supported the flat concrete canopy over the wide two-step porch at the entrance.
 The columns, when knocked at, sounded differently letting play the phrase "do-re-mi-do-re-do!", thanks to precise tone pitch of the iron pipes.
</p><p>Although the institute had also the Department of Music Teachers, yet the honor of that particular music discovery belonged to a student of the English Department who graduated before my enrollment.
 As for the mentioned music phrase, it was an old-time curse used by the <em>lahboohs.</em>
 Wherever you played it, any<em> lahbooh, </em>if he happened around, would get at once that old good jive running, "Go and fuck yourself, jerk!" One syllable for each note, exactly…
</p><p>The glazed  door on the porch let you inside the small glass-walled cage of vestibule with another door opening into the lobby in whose  right corner there stood a sizable desk with the on-duty watchwoman behind it guarding the square shield of plywood fixed on the wall, with rows of nails for hanging the keys to the rooms in the Hosty.
 If the nail beneath the ink-written ‘72’ was empty, then one of my roommates had already grabbed the key and passed over to the room.
</p><p>In the long corridor behind the lobby you could take any, either right or  left, turn and reach one of the two staircases to the upper floors, yet the left one was the shorter route to Room 72.
</p><p>Each of the floors belonged to a different department, aka faculty. Thus, the second floor was inhabited by the students of the Biology Department, aka Bio-Fac.
 The English Department, aka Anglo-Fac, posessed the third floor.
 Mathematicians from the Phys-Mat lived on the fourth, and the uppermost—fifth floor—was for the Music-Pedagogical Department, aka Mus-Ped...
</p><p>On any floor, leaving the staircase landing, you entered a long, pretty dark, corridor to which the light was getting from its opposite ends, through two high windows spanned between the floor and the ceiling. The rest of the scenery was made of walls with rows of closed doors above the smoothly ground dark-gray concrete in the floor.
</p><p>Room 72 followed the washroom of six sinks, which was the first from the corridor window, opposite the door to the men's toilet on the other side of the same window. At the opposite end of the long corridor, everything was exactly the same, only the toilet there was for ladies.
 </p><p>On entering the room, you got into its narrowest part squeezed between the four plywood lockers reaching the ceiling—two of them on each side.
 After the lockers, the room became a bit wider to accommodate a bed, a cabinet-box, and another bed lined under each of the side walls. The wide, three-winged, window was right ahead with two more cabinet-boxes under its sill.
 The center of the room was occupied by the dark-brown varnish-scarred veteran of a table with four wooden chairs pushed under, so that you could bypass it when heading to the window.
</p><p>The soiled spots in the wallpaper marked the places where the inmates or their visitors habitually leaned their heads taking a seat upon the bed covers, while the  wallpaper cleaner stretches bore dense columns of inscribed  card debt records and scores in Throw-in-Fool competitions.
 </p><p>The round tin box in the center of the whitewashed ceiling slab contained two light bulbs. The room was also equipped with two wall sockets and the switch by the door.
 However, from midnight till six in the morning the electricity in the Hosty rooms was turned off by the on-duty watchwoman, with the general switch near her post. G’night, sleep tight, Jesus Christ Super Star, in  the flock of rented tape-recorders on window-sills!.
</p><p>For those eager to gnaw and bore the granite of the science, there was a reading room in the corridor on the first floor next to the hall with a TV box.
 In both the electricity was in place through all the night.
</p><p>However, the reading room got empty long before the midnight, as well as the hall with the TV, except for the nights of an international football match or a new 4-sequel musical with Andrey Mironov in it…</p>
