<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Besides the pigeons, I also liked holidays, especially the New Year.
The Christmas tree was set up in the parents’ room in front of the white tulle curtain screening the cold balcony door. The plywood boxes from postal parcels received long ago and presently full of fragile sparkling adoration came from the narrow storeroom: all kinds of fruits, dwarfs, bells, grandfathers frosts, baskets, drill-bit-like purple icicles, balls with inlaid snowflakes on their opposite sides and just balls but also beautiful, stars framed within thin glass tubes, fluffy rain-garlands from golden foil.
</p><p>In addition, we made paper garland-chains as taught by Mom. With different watercolors we painted the paper, it dried overnight and was cut into finger-wide colored strips which we glued with wheatpaste into lots of multicolored links in the growing catenas of our handmade garlands.
</p><p>Lastly, after decorating the tree with toys and sweetmeat—because a candy with a thread through its bright wrapper served both nice and eatable decoration which you could cut off and enjoy at Xmastide—a snowdrift of white cotton wool was put under the tree to hide the plywood footing of one-foot-tall Grandfather Frost in his red broadcloth coat with one mitten in firm clasp on his big staff and the other clutching the sack over his shoulder sewn with too-tight stitches for you to check what it held.
</p><p>Oh! How could I forget the multicolored twinkling of tiny bulbs on their long thin wires?!. They came into the Christmas tree before anything else, and those wires were connected to the heavy electric transformer also hidden under the wool snowdrifts; Dad made it himself.
</p><p>And the mask of Bear for the matinée in the kindergarten was also his production. Mom explained him how to do it and Dad brought some special clay from his work and then on a sheet of plywood he modeled the bear’s face with its stuck-up nose. When the clay got stone-hard, Dad and Mom covered it with layers of gauze and water-soaked shreds of newspaper.
</p><p>It took two days for the muzzle to dry and harden, then the clay was thrown away and—wow!—there was a mask made of papier-mache. The mask was colored with brown watercolor, and  Mom sewed the Bear costume of brown satin, it was a one-piece affair so you could get into the trousers only through the jacket. That’s why at the matinée I did not envy the woodcutters with the cardboard axes over their shoulders.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…and until now the watercolors smell to me of the New Year, or maybe vice verse – it’s hard to decide, I’m not too good at moot points…)
</p></div><p>If the big bed in the parents’ room was taken apart and brought to our room, it meant that later in the evening they would haul tables from the neighboring apartments and set them in the freed bedroom for guests to sit around. The neighbors’ children would gather in our room to play.
</p><p>When it got very late and all the visiting children  gone back already to their apartments, I would venture to the parents’ room filled with the thin smarting mist of tobacco smoke and the noise of loud voices from everyone trying to speak louder than anyone else. Old Morozov would announce that being a young man he once oared no less than seventeen kilometers to a date, and some man would eagerly affirm that deed meant it was worth it and all the people would rejoice at the good news and laugh happily and they would grab each other and dance filling all of the room with their giant figures up to the ceiling and circle along with the disc on the gramophone brought by someone of the guests.
</p><p>Then they again would speak without listening to each other, and Mom, sitting at the table, would start to sing about the lights on the streets of the Saratov City, and her eyelids would fall halfway onto her eyes. Mortified with shame at that view, I would get onto her lap and say, “Mom, don’t sing, please, don’t!” And she would laugh, and push the glass back, and say she did not drink anymore and go on singing all the same.
</p><p>Then the guests would go to their apartments taking out the tables and still talking without listening. I would be sent to our room with Sasha already sleeping on the sofa but Natasha still awake. From the kitchen, there would come the tinkle of the dishes being washed up by Grandma and Mom, and then the light in our room would be turned on shortly for the parent bed parts to be taken away…
</p><p>Besides her work, Mom also was taking part in the Artistic Amateur Activities at the House of Officers which was very far to go and I knew it because at times the parents took me to the cinema there, to the great envy of the twins.
</p><p>All the movies started with loud music and the big round clock on the Kremlin tower opening a newsreel “The News of the Day”, but then one of that news frightened me to tears with jerky bulldozers in fascist concentration camps whose blades were pushing heaps of naked corpses to fill deep trenches. Mom told me to shut my eyes and not watch, and after that, they didn’t take me to the cinema anymore.
</p><p>However, when the Artistic Amateur Activities performed their concert at the House of Officers, Dad took me along. Different  Artistic Amateur Activities people sang from the scene with the accompaniment of the same  button accordion and the audience clapped so loudly. Then the whole scene was left for just one man who talked for a long time, yet I couldn’t get it what about even though he made his voice louder and louder until there again was clapping from all the sides. And that way it went on  with singing and talking and clapping in between, but I waited only to see my Mom on the scene.
</p><p>At last, when a lot of women in the same long skirts came to dance with a lot of men in high boots, Dad said, “Aha! Here is your dear Mommy!” But I could not make her out because the long skirts were all alike and made the women so too similar to each other. Dad had to point again who was my Mom and after that, I looked only at her so as not to lose.
</p><p>If not for such intent attention, I would have, probably, missed the moment which stuck in me for many years like a splinter that you cannot pull out and it’s just better not to press the spot where it sits…The women dancers on the scene were spinning ever quicker and their long skirts also swerved rising to their knees, but my Mom’s skirt splashed suddenly to flash her legs up to the very panties.
</p><p>Unbearable shame flooded me and for the rest of the concert, I kept my head down never looking up from the floor beneath my felt boots no matter how loudly they clapped, and all the long way home I did not want to talk with either of the parents and did not answer why I was so pouty.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…in those irrevocably faraway times—past any reach, recall, redress—I hadn’t realized yet…)
</p></div><p>But, hey! Really, what’s the point in those concerts at all if there was a shiny brown radio box on the wall in our—children’s—room?
</p><p>It could both talk and sing, and play music, we knew it very well that when they broadcast Arkady Raikin you should turn the white knob of the volume control to make it louder, then run and call everyone in the house to haste to our room for laughing all together back to the box on the wall.
</p><p>And we learned to hush the radio or even turn it off when there was a concert for the cello and orchestra, or if someone was telling what good news was the news about the victory of revolution in Cuba which made him so happy that he turned out two daily tasks during one shift just for spite of the revenge-seekers and their leader Adenauer…
</p><p>Yet, the May Day celebration was not a home holiday at all.
</p><p>First, you had to walk a long way by the road descending away past the Block’s corner building and there, at the foot of the Gorka hill, to go walking on and on.
</p><p>And there were lots of people going the same way, both adults and children.
People greeted each other cheerfully, in their hands they carried bunches of balloons or pliant twigs with handmade leaves of green tissue paper fixed with tightly spun black threads, or long pieces of red cloth with big white letters in between a pair of poles, and also portraits of different men, both bold and not too much so, set upon stubby sticks.
</p><p>Like almost all the children, I had a short square pennant in my hands, on a thin—like a pencil, only a tad bit longer—rod.
</p><p>In the red pennant, the yellow circle criss-crossed with yellow grid represented the globe, and a yellow dove soared above it, yet not as high as the string of yellow letters reading: “Peace to the World!”
Of course, I couldn’t read at that time but those flags remained unchangeable for years and decades.
</p><p>And as we all walked on, in the distance ahead of us, there emerged music. It sounded louder and louder, and then we passed by the line of soldier-musicians with shining trumpets and booming drum, and past a tall red balcony with people on it in their forage caps, but that balcony, strangely, had no house behind it…
</p><p>After one of the May Days, I felt like drawing a holiday so Grandma gave me a sheet of ruled paper and a pencil.
</p><p>In the center of the sheet, I drew a large balloon on a string going down to the bottom edge of the paper. It looked good, so big and festive.
However, I wanted more than that, I wanted the holiday be all over the world and, to the right from the balloon, I drew a blind plank fence behind which there lived not ours but the Germans and other enemies from the newsreels in the House of Officers, only all of them invisible, of course, because of the fence.
</p><p>Okay, Germans, let it be a holiday even for you!
</p><p>And I drew another balloon on the string rising from behind the fence. Lastly, to make it clear who is who and who is where the enemies’ balloon got marked with a thick cross.
</p><p>The masterpiece accomplished, I shortly admired my art and then ran to share it, for a starter, with Grandma…
</p><p>At first, she couldn’t figure out what is what, and I had to explain to her the picture. But when I got to the point that let even Germans have a holiday – we are not meanies, right? – she stopped me abruptly with severe criticism.
</p><p>I should have learned since long, said she, that because of my those cross-adorned balloons, the “black raven” vehicle would stop by our house and take my Dad away arrested, and she asked if that was what I wanted.
</p><p>I felt sorry for Dad and terrified by the prospect to be left without him. I burst into tears and crushed the ill-fated drawing, then ran to the bathroom, and thrust the crumpled paper ball behind the pig-iron door of the water boiler Titan where they lighted fire when heating water for the bathing…</p>
