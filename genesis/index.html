<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Genesis<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Your ken of your own lineage on the paternal side feels kinda falty, right? Whereas  I feel comfortably confident as to your Mom’s family tree properly watered and inspected for a couple of generations, if not deeper, thanks to the detailed feeds from your grandmother.
</p><p>The reasonable doubt about my pedigree ever mentioned to you arose after a sudden letter from your mother to inform me of my death.
Not as abruptly though, she kindly softened the impact pointing out that after you were told that your Dad was dead I'd better abstain from afflicting the still fragile psyche of the child with exposure to a chance running into the revenant ghost of her father... Could I politely keep to my grave?
</p><p>Since then, when in a pub a fella next to me got in the mood to bend my ear with  a plaintive tale of his being nobody these days while in his prime he used to be Chief Mate of a nuke submarine, I felt a solid right and no scruples to cut his lamentation and drive it back that I was a widely famous pilot tragically killed at shakedown flights of the jet fighter starting the newest highly secret brand...
 For which unparalleled achievement I, by the way, got awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union together with the Gold Star medal. Posthumously, of course, and it’s a sad pity the award didn’t find the hero because those bitches never search in earnest…
</p><p>The bullshit, to be honest, was not an item of my snappy creativity but a commonplace mass-product because in that romantic epoch, when a single-mothered kid started hitting up the reasons for the incomplete composition of their family, Mom’s stopgap, traditionally, sounded as follows, “Your father was a pilot and he crashed.”
<br>The brute facts of life were shared to her bosom lady-friends, “He was a junior bookkeeper, guys, and spread me on his office desk, O, my! Never will I forget that fucking abacus trundling back and forth under my ass…”
</p><p>Nonetheless, don’t expect of me a fine-grained presentation of your roots because my knowledge of the matter is way too shallow and fuzzy because the interest in eugenics was truly frowned at then, no less than now…
</p><p>The name of your father’s mother’s mother was Katerina Poyonk and she was brought from Poland by your great-grandfather, Joseph Vakimov, a commissar in the 1-st Cavalry Army of Semyon Budyonny, as a trophy, or maybe a keepsake of that period in the Civil War when Budyonny’s cavalry nearly turned Warsaw their spoils.
</p><p>Their relationship was legalized by the then Civil Registry Office, aka ZAGS, and eight years later my mother, Galina, was born to be followed by her brother, Vadim, and their sister, Lyudmila. In recollections of those three, Joseph was very clever. He knew Jewish as well as German languages and was embracing the position of a Regional Trade Auditor in Ukraine. During that period Katerina had a separate pair of shoes for each of her frocks.
</p><p>Seven more years passed and, in the late thirties, Joseph was arrested. They did not put him before a firing squad though to purge away like millions of other “enemies to the Soviet people”, supposedly, some clever way to buy his life back  was found to get only deported instead to a very northern, however, European part of Russia. The family joined him in exile and in the early forties, they all returned to Ukraine to live in the city of Konotop which soon afterward was captured by the German Wehrmacht.
</p><p>After two years of the Nazi occupation, when German troops retreated westward under the blows of the Red Army, my grandfather disappeared from home one day before the liberation, together with his bicycle — a pretty valuable item in those times.
</p><p>The next morning, heavy bombardment made Katerina and her three children flee as far as the suburban village of Podlipnoye, where a shell fragment cut an apple branch right above my mother’s head (a telling detail, if not for the odd inches I wouldn’t now be composing this letter to you). By noon, the advancing troops of the Red Army liberated both the village and the city. Katerina came back to Konotop where she brought up, as a single mother, her children — Galina, Vadim, and Lyudmila…
</p><p>Another ten years passed and Galina, the eldest of the three, by way of postal acquaintance met Nikolai Ogoltsoff, a petty officer of the Order of Combat Red Banner Black Sea Fleet. “Postal acquaintance” meant the postman to bring a letter started with, “Hello, unknown Galina…”, and concluded,”…Send me your photo, please!”
</p><p>So, on his next year furlough Nikolai, instead of customary visiting his native Ryazan Region in Russia,  arrived in the Ukrainian city of Konotop where the width of both his flaring Navy pants and his chest under the striped vest as well as his sailor’s cap with golden-lettered legend “The Black Sea Fleet” in the ribbon over his forehead let loosely hang as two black tails with imprints of also golden anchors at the back of his head, another shining anchor (this time of brass) in his polished belt plate impressed the quiet streets in the town outskirts where he sent his letters to in envelopes decorated with the hand-written line added by him on behind, “Fly with my greetings, come back with the promise of meetings!.”
</p><p>And three days later my parents, without ever asking my grandmother, registered their marriage in the Konotop ZAGS…
</p><p>Was my missing grandpa Joseph a Jew?.<br>
Being a commissar in the years of the Civil War, proficiency with the language in question, and even his name itself might serve a bunch of circumstantial evidence to the assumption.
 However, the high percentage of the chosen people’s offsprings among the revolutionary leaders of the period does not remove the possibility of exceptions. The language could have been acquired when he was an errand-boy and/or shop assistant at a store of some Jew merchant. As for the name, let's not forget that even such a hardened anti-Semite as Comrade Stalin was his namesake...
Still and all, my mother, when introducing herself, preferred to change her Old Testament rooted patronymic into its Russianized version “Osipovna”.
</p><p>Her dark mellow eyes she inherited from Katerina Ivanovna (or Katarzyna Janovna?) whose affinity with the tribes of Israel looked doubtful enough.
</p><p>Firstly, in the red corner of her kitchen there hung a dark lacquered board with some glum-bearded saint (I can’t say of which religion or nationality, could be a Catholic as well). Besides, she fattened a pig in her shed, Masha was her name, for slaughter.
</p><p>But, again, the icon might have taken root as a camouflaging part of the interior in the time of Nazi occupation, while the restrictions of kosher diet can be overruled with the common Ukrainian proverb – “Need teaches eating cakes with lard”.
</p><p>Of course, all these unanswerable questions will arise after the return of your ancestors from their marriage registration at Konotop ZAGS, but we are not to follow them along with all that way, we are taking a U-turn – to trace the line of your grandfather’s father’s origin.
</p><p>That line is simple, straight, and down-to-earth. In a word, Mikhail Ogoltsoff was a peasant.
</p><p>In the depths of the Ryazan land, there is the district center of Sapozhok and at nine or eleven kilometers from it (the distance depends on who was asked the question), you find the village of Kanino. My father liked to brag that in its fat days the village had about four hundred households.
</p><p>The shallow ravine with a soundless sluggish brook along its bottom divide the village into two halves. Back in the blessed days of yore, the stream banks served the grounds for the long-standing folk amusement “Battling Walls”, aka collective fist-fight. The men from one half of the village devotedly punched the the other-half dwellers, smashing their teeth out to celebrate some church holiday or just a pleasant Sunday day.
Yeah, once upon a time folks knew how to entertain themselves…
</p><p>And so it went on for centuries before sinking into oblivion. Only vague memories remained of Alesha the Saddler – the legendary fighter and obedient son. But his Dad was a truly uptight geezer! “Where to?” would yell he at the scion. “Too filthy rich you are, eh? Back to work and no nonsense!”
<br>And the mighty three-and-thirty-year-old son would stoop his bulky shoulders over the unfinished horse-collar, poking it with his awl while all of him was there, by the stream, from where little boys ran panting in with the updates, “Oh, Alesha! They are pressing indeed! Ours give in already!”
<br>Yet, the warning snort from his father would keep Alesha silent and concentrated on his toil until many “a-heck!” and “plunks!” of a dogged retreat in the street reached the hut. At that point, Dad would no longer keep his temper down. Springing up to his feet, he would run to Alesha and deal him a huge box on the ear and yell, “Fuck it! Ours bite the dust but this dickhead still sits home!”
<br>But Alesha didn’t hear the whole oration, he's out already, bypassing the battling “Walls” through the village backyard kitchen gardens because the rules forbid attacking the opposite team from behind; a good game calls for fair play.
<br>“Alesha’s out!” And “the ours” get a second breath right away while the opposite “Wall” show streaks of wavering. Some weaklings start falling down in advance – the rules do not allow to beat a fighter lying on the ground. And Alesha, deeply concentrated, knocks the standing fighters out one after another; and, mark you, without a single f-f..er..foul word...
Yep, the village was in the pink then…
</p><p>The Rural Collectivization in the USSR finished off that innocent merry-making and the well-concerted Great Hunger, called to solidify the revolutionary changes in the Russian rustic life, knocked Alesha off, and his father, sure enough, also starved to death…
</p><p>My father’s mother, Martha, remembered the life under the Czar because at the break of the Great October Revolution she was a girl of about thirteen. Ten years later she was already married to Mikhail Ogoltsoff to bring forth three children: Kolya, Sehrguey, and Alexandra (respectively).
</p><p>Mikhail lived through the start of collectivization but the Great Hunger made him pass on and Martha remained a single mother. She cooked soup of saltbush and less edible herbs. Both she and her children were swelling up from starvation but survived.
</p><p>Then there arrived the era of hard labor at the collective farm, aka kolkhoz, with its miserly paid workdays. Life kept spinning around those “workdays” paid in kind with the same products the villagers produced slaving in the kolkhoz fields, and recreation at the kolkhoz club where twice a month they brought Soviet movies "Lenin in October",  "Pigwoman and Shepherd" and other suchlike stuff. To make movie-watching possible, the village lads had to rotate the crank of a portable dynamo machine generating electricity for the film projector.
</p><p>In the summer of 1941, Comrade Joseph Stalin announced the treacherous invasion of fascist Germany into the Soviet Union, and the village mujiks were driven away to the war.
</p><p>The Germans never reached Kanino though the thunder of the front-line cannonade was rolling in from the horizon. Then in the village came detachments of the Red Army reserve, the mujiks from Siberia with their astounding custom to take a steam bath and then sit outside in the frosty winter night to have a thoughtful smoke with just their undershirts on.
</p><p>The Siberians left in the direction of the cannonade and soon afterward it ceased to be heard. In the village, pervaded with thick silence, there stayed only women, girls and boys too young to be drafted. And—yes!—the collective farm chairman; a one-armed cripple in the military outfit.
</p><p>And so it went on and on, not for days or weeks but for months, from year to year. Under the circumstances, there sprang up and got on a verifiable sexual quirk permeating the womenfolk. They would gather in one or another hut with a view to inspect one or another quim of theirs, exchange comments and judgments, evaluate the appeal…
</p><p>Getting on the scent of this Sapphism Renaissance, the kolkhoz chairman had a crack at eradication of the collective lesbian kink before the rumors reached the authorities in the district center, and he called a general meeting of exclusively women and girls in the kolkhoz club.
</p><p>The male youths participated also, on the quiet. They crawled to the projectionist booth in the club and, with their jaws a-hanging, witnessed the chairman to cheer the congregation up with all kinds of curses. He repeatedly knocked his only fist at the desk to accompany his solemn oaths of cutting out that rotten cunt-watching. (I mitigate, in part, the artless charm hitched to the bucolic figures of speech in the chairman’s proclamation.)
</p><p>My father never knew if the cripple did keep his promise because he (my father) was drafted into the Red Army. Or rather, in his case, it was the Navy but Red all the same…
