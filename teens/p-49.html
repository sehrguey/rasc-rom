 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>When we moved to Konotop, my first and foremost responsibility became fetching the water supply for our <em>khutta.</em>
 </p><p>A pair of enamel pails full of water stood in the dark nook of the tiny veranda, on two back-to-back stools next to the kerosene stove. From a nail in the plank wall above the pails, there hung a dipper for drinking or filling a cooking pan. But first, the pails were used to fill up the tank of the washstand in the kitchen that held exactly two pailfuls.
 </p><p>The tap, sticking from under the tank mounted above the tin sink, trickled water when pressed from underneath, as those spring taps in the toilets of passenger train cars.
 </p><p>The soapsuds dripped from the sink into the cabinet under it containing the slop bucket which needed control checks  not to let it brim over and flood the kitchen floor but to be taken out before too late and emptied into the spill pit next to the outhouse in the garden.
 </p><p>The water was from the pump on the corner of Nezhin and Gogol Streets,  some forty meters from the wicket. Hanging a pail on the pig-iron nose of the pump, you gave a hearty push-down to the iron handle behind it for the vigorous stream to bang into the pail, fill it, and run over onto the road if not watched closely.
 </p><p>Two daily water-walks–four pails, all in all–were enough for our khutta, if, of course, there was no washing that day, however, the water for Aunt Lyuda’s washing was fetched by Uncle Tolik...
 </p><p>When the rains set in, the water-walks became a little longer – you had to navigate bypassing the wide puddles in the road.
 </p><p>In winter the pump got surrounded by a small, yet ripping slippery, skating rink from the water spill-splashed by the pump users, the resulting smooth ice had to be walked in tiny careful steps.
  The dark winter evenings made you appreciate the right positioning of the log lamppost next to the pump...
</p><p>Besides, I was in charge of fetching fuel for the kerogas that looked like a small gas stove with two burners and had two cups on its backside to fill them with kerosene that soaked, through two thin tubes, two circular wicks of asbestos which were lighted when cooking dinner, heating water for tea or the washing at hand on the smelly yellow flames with  jerky jagged tips of black soot.
</p><p>After kerosene, I went to Bazaar with a twenty-liter tin canister. <br>Fairly aside from the Bazaar counters, there stood a big cubic tank of rusty sheet iron.
 The day of kerosene sale was announced in the chalk note over the tank side – "kerosene will be ..." and then followed the date when they were to bring it. However, so too many dates had changed each other—wiped and written over and over again—that no figures could be read inside the thick chalk spot, that’s why they just dropped writing and the tank side greeted you with the  perpetually optimistic line, "kerosene will be ...!”
</p><p>A shallow trench under the tank side accommodated a short pipe from its bottom ending with  a tap blocked by a padlock.
 <br>On the proclaimed day, a saleswoman in a blue satin robe descended into the trench and sat by the tap on a small stool ferried along. She also brought   a multi-liter aluminum cauldron,  and put it under the tap, took the padlock away and filled the vessel, up to three-quarters, with the foamy yellowish jet of kerosene.
</p><p>The queue started moving to her with their bottles, canisters, and cans which she filled with a dipper through a tin funnel, collecting the pay into her blue pocket. When the dipper began to dub the cauldron bottom, she turned the tap on to restore the fluid level.
</p><p>In fact, they didn't need at all to bother about   writing the sale date, because each morning Grandma Katya visited Bazaar and two days ahead brought the news when "kerosene will be …!" indeed.
</p><p>So, on the kerosene sale day after coming from school, I took the canister and went to spend a couple of hours in the line to the trench under the tank.
</p><p>Sometimes, they were also selling it in the Nezhin Store backyard equipped with the same facility, but that happened not as often and the line was no shorter…
 </p><p>Soon after the summer holidays, I was elected Chairman of the Pioneer Platoon Council of our 7th "B" grade because the former Chairman (the  red-haired skinny Yemets) moved to some other city together with her parents.
 </p><p>At the Pioneer Platoon meeting, two of the nominees announced self-withdrawal without giving any particular reasons for their refusal, and the Senior Pioneer Leader of our school pushed forward my candidature.
 <br>Following the trend, I also started sluggish excuses, which he rebuffed with energetic clarification that all that was not for long because we all were soon to become members of the Leninist Young Communist League, aka Komsomol.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...the structure of the pioneer organizations in the Soviet Union presented an awesome example of organization based on precise and well-thought-out organizational principles for organizing any workable organization.
</p><p>In every Soviet school,  each class of students who reached the stipulated age automatically became a Platoon of Young Pioneers  divided into Pioneer Rings.
 Ring Leaders together with Platoon Chairman formed the Council of the Pioneer Platoon.
  Chairmen of the Pioneer Platoons made up the Council of the School Pioneer Company.
Then there came District or City Pioneer Organizations converging into Republican ones which, in their turn, composed the All-Union Pioneer Organization.
</p><p>Such a crystal-wise-structured pyramid for convenient handling...
 That is why the heroes of Komsomol resistance underground during the German occupation of Krasnodon City did not have to reinvent the wheel.
 They used the all too familiar structure after renaming "rings" into "cells"...
<br>If, of course, we take for granted the attestation found in <em>The Young Guard</em>, the novel written by A. Fadeyev.
 </p><p>He composed his work on the basis of information provided by the relatives of Oleg Koshevoy. As a result, in the mentioned novel Oleg became the underground leader while Victor Tretyakevich, who, actually, accepted Oleg to the resistance organization, was depicted as the traitor under the name of Stakhevich.
 </p><p>Fourteen years after the book publication, Tretyakevich was rehabilitated and awarded an order posthumously because he did not die during interrogations at organs of the Soviet NKVD  but was executed by the fascist invaders.
 </p><p>In the early sixties, a few other secondary traitors, whose names the writer did not bother to disguise, had served from ten to fifteen years in the NKVD camps and got rehabilitated as well.
  </p><p>By that moment, the writer himself had time enough to put a bullet through his head in May 1956, shortly after his participation in the meeting of Nikita Khrushchev, the then leader of the USSR, with the survived young guardsmen of Krasnodon.
 </p><p>At that meeting, Fadeyev grew inadequately nervous and yelled at Khrushchev in front of all the present, calling him names considered especially defamatory at that period, and two days later he committed suicide.
 Or else, they committed his suicide though, of course, such an expression—"they committed his suicide"—is unacceptable by the language norms.
</p><p>Hence the moral – even the cleverest structure cannot guarantee from a collapse if your pyramid is not made of at least 16-ton stone blocks...)
</p></div><p>Late September, Chairman of our School Pioneer Company fell ill and, in his stead, I was delegated to the City Pioneer Organization Account Meeting of the Chairmen of the Councils of City School Pioneer Companies.
</p><p>The Meeting was held in the Konotop House of Pioneers in secluded location behind the Monument to Fallen Heroes above Lenin Street.
 </p><p>According to the organization regulations, an Account Meeting had to have its Chairman and Secretary. The Meeting Chairman’s job was to announce whose turn it was to account, and  Secretary would take notes of how much waste paper and scrap metal was collected by the pioneers of the reporting Chairman’s school during the accounting period, which cultural events were organized, and what places were taken by their pioneers in the city-wide contests and competitions.
 </p><p>The Senior Pioneer Leader of our school had supplied me with a sheet of paper to be read at the Account Meeting but, in the House of Pioneers, they charged me with the additional responsibility of the appointed Chairman of the Meeting. I was assured that presiding an Account Meeting was as easy as pie. All you had to do was to announce, “And now the floor for the accounting report is given to  Chairman of the Pioneer Company Council from School number such-and-such!” after which the  such-and-such Chairman would march to the rostrum on stage with their sheet of  report. When done with reading, the accounting Chairman would leave the paper to Secretary of the Meeting, because what’s the point in sticking down all those figures on the fly if they had been already written, right?.
 </p><p>At first, everything went without a hitch. I and Secretary of Account Meeting, a girl in her festive white shirt and the scarlet pioneer necktie, as anyone else around, were sitting behind a square desk covered with a dark red cloth on a small stage in a small hall, where Chairmen of the City Pioneer Companies were seated in rows waiting for their turn to read their accounts. In the rear of the hall, Second Secretary of the City Komsomol Committee—responsible for the work with the pioneers—sat in her red pioneer necktie.
 </p><p>The Chairmen in a well-oiled manner followed each other, read from their sheets, left them by Secretary of Account Meeting, and returned to the audience. I also did my part as instructed but after the fourth announcement, something suddenly came over me or rather flooded over me.
 </p><p>My mouth got inundated with overflowing saliva, I barely had time to gulp it before the salivary glands turned out a new excessive portion to fill me with shame before  Secretary of Account Meeting sitting next to me who surely was perplexed with the sounds of my non-stop hurried gulping. A spell of ease came when she went to account for School 10, yet, with her return, the disgraceful torture went on. What’s wrong with me, after all?!.
 </p><p>Then came my turn. Returning from the rostrum, I swallowed three times; it did not help though. Okay, let School 14 finish and…Oh, no! Second Secretary too, with her concluding speech!.
 </p><div id="span"><p>(…in those irrevocably faraway times—past any reach, recall, redress—I hadn’t realized yet that all my grieves and joys and stuff sprang from that rascal in the unfathomably distant future who’s now composing this letter to you stretched on my back inside this here one-person tent surrounded by a dark forest in the middle of nowhere and the never subsiding whoosh of the river currently named Varanda…)</p>
