 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part two)<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>The position of senior pioneer leader was filled with my course-mate, Irina from Bakhmach.
I somehow did not immediately realize that she was courting me, until her invitation to the ancient tower of Sednev with its small built-in romantic restaurant.
</p><p>Through the loopholes in the thick (of about a meter-and-a-half) walls, on the plain far below, the fleeing shadows from summer clouds raced by like a horde   of raiding robbers...
She treated me to the blackberry liqueur, yet I did not like that over-sweetened cloying swill.
</p><p>After two years of studying at the pedagogical institute, Irina obviously re-evaluated the standpoints and priorities entertained by her during the night which we spend together when being first-year students. However, I couldn't respond to her advances in a natural way. Not because of being a vengeful jackass, "aha! you didn't give it then, so go without now!" No, it's not like me.
The reason was my dutiful submissiveness to the received instructions. When said "no", I retreat obediently, but in order for me to get at it again, there should be an explicit invitation "come on, let’s do it".
She pinned her hopes on the liqueur alone which was not straightforward enough...
</p><p>And I also couldn't concentrate on the other trainee, one more Irina, but already from Nezhin, the daughter of Pro-Rector Budowski.
Firstly, I disliked both his bald head and his moral character in general, and secondly, she was an unmistakable virgin.
</p><p>Consequently, the champion laurels in the contest, quite predictably and inevitably, went to the blonde sports trainer, again Irina, from the adjacent "The Young Chemist" camp.
At first, we had dates on the riverbank in the company of her "Spidola" receiver, but in my gym, it was much warmer...
</p><p>Once I entertained a group of visitors comprising Slavik, Twoic, and Petyunya for playing Preferans, and Sveta for everything else.
</p><p>After the game, the boys started racing around the gym after the hedgehog brought to me by pioneer kids earlier on that day. I asked them to stop molesting the poor creature, and they switched over to voyeuristic eavesdropping to the erotic arias sounding from the partition to the radio-unit room, where Irina from Bakhmach entertained a guest who visited her on the same day, also a Bakhmach guy.
</p><p>Then I gave the boys a bundle of camp cloth blankets to soften their sleep on the bare floorboards and turned off the light.
Sveta, who had the legitimate right to a part of my bed, performed from that elevation before the three, frozen in awe and admiration, music lovers on the floor, a concert for a flute without an orchestra…
</p><p>Another time I went to Nezhin, sort of a day off, but there I behaved like a disgusting swine.
I swallowed too much of pills, and dining in the canteen room at the station I almost dozed off over the bowl of borshch, as if it was a kinda pillow. Naturally, Eera got outraged and left.
Slavik, who was also going to Chernigov, had to drag me, like a vegetable, into the diesel train. Because the branch line to Chernigov was not electrified...
Traveling by the diesel train, I slept off but still remained bored utterly because everything was so dull…
</p><p>I felt like that for the most time of that practice.
So dull and unnecessary was my lie to a mujik in the fields, who asked which camp I belonged to. Why did I say I was from "The Chemist"?
</p><p>And it was dull when a pack of youngsters from Chernigov came to the pine forest by the daddy's Volga of some of them.
They kicked up thief-swaggering and one of them pulled out a big handsome dagger, I looked around for a stick, although he obviously wanted to get relieved of the weapon. A split-second of delay, the moment was lost and the trophy went to the chauffeur of the camp. Well done, mujik!
</p><p>And because of being bored and off-hand, when diving in the river from the bluff I, like, dislocated something in my back and a couple of days was turning to the sides with my whole body.
</p><p>Taking a swim at night was dull as well, even after some car drove on the bank flashing the headlights at the girls, who had already changed their mind to enter the river, and I had to get out of the water in the altogether, just as I had come to this world, armed only with a distorted expression of the unshaven face.
It’s hard to say what aboriginal mask my mug looked like at that moment, but they switched off the headlights.
The next day Irina from Bakhmach was making sport of my dick size not living up visually to her  expectations. It did not hurt my feelings though because everything was so dull and boring...
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"A vain present, a chance present,<br>
Why are you given to me, Life?."
</p><p>Yet, when on  Poseidon Day the pioneers of both camps united in catching and dragging me along to drop into a pond by the river, it was not boring, it was right.
At first, I felt offended and wet, but then like laughing. Well done, kids! Serves good the bastard!.
</p><p>The last night at the camp, Irina the trainer and I once again sat on the river bank. There were so many stars that you could hardly see the sky behind them, and I had blues that everything was somehow flowing away and getting lost.
She, for some reason, did not want to have a sex, and we just sat leaning our backs against each other.
The stars were glittering both from below—reflected in the silent flow of the Snov—and also from above. They crowded everywhere and would always be and still it was impossible to keep them. Everything flows away...
</p><p>Probably, I had blues because of the "Spidola" was babbling a sermon in English.
I did not understand at all what all that was about, because it was not the English Department Language Laboratory texts about the family of Parkers, but you could guess that it was a sermon.
</p><p>Then I escorted Irina to "The Young Chemist".
She went in and locked the gate, but I called her again. We climbed the grating of the gate from both sides and had the final kiss, a camp kiss atop of the grates.
Forgive me and goodbye, my loss…
</p><p>I knew the city of Pryluky for a long time, yet in absentia.
The cigarette packs of Prima acquainted me with the city's name printed on their back, "cigarette factory m. Pryluky."
During the years of German occupation, the city of Pryluky was drastically rebuilt, so the streets in it became strictly parallel and methodically perpendicular to each other. Except for the outskirts where the bus station was built later...
</p><p>Commander of the student construction platoon was Vladimir Maiba, from the Physics and Mathematics Department.
The platoon's Commissar was Igor, a Ukrainian nationalist, who suspected Maiba of being a secret collaborator with the KGB and, therefore, was constantly jeering at him and discrediting his authority in every possible way.
And I was Leading Specialist, sort of, because in my military ID they advertised me as a "bricklayer".
</p><p>Besides the mentioned commanding staff, there were two girls and fifteen guys in the platoon. In the city we stayed at a hostel of "chemists" but just for one night and the next morning, we had to leave for Auto-Depot 4 located at the nearby highway between the Ivkovtsy village and the town of Ladan.
</p><p>"Chemists" was the general term for prisoners who, because of their supposedly good behavior, were paroled from Zona to finish off their time "at the chemistry".
Any plant or a factory with production lines hazardous to health, or a mine, or a construction site usually served "the chemistry" grounds for paroled <em>zeks</em>.
The regulations for "chemists" were pretty strict. They should be present in the hostel no later than the hour specified, never get drunk, nor bring whores and abide by many other restrictions. However, they were not locked and controlled by the turnkeys and did not sleep in the common dormitory. They even got some payment though decimated by their curator militiaman  who decided whether they remain on parole or get remanded back to Zona...
</p><p>After the shower, I and Igor, who, regardless of his being a Ukranian nationalist, spoke a very good Russian and dreamed of moving to St. Petersburg, the cultural capital, went out to check the geometrical correctness of Pryluky.
</p><p>"Katranikha! I am damned! Is that you?"
</p><p>"Don't shout! Some of my students may be around. I'm a teacher here."
</p><p>Well, of course, sorry, how could I forget myself. For one year already she was disseminating there the seeds of the wisdom, of kindness, and values eternal… </p>
