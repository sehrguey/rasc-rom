 <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part two)<br>&nbsp;</h3>


 <p>Every good news has some crappy lining. Hardly I rejoiced that sending down whizzed harmlessly by, as it was time to stick my neck again into the hateful noose. The KGB captain beaconed with his newspaper: come to report and get instructions.
 At the secret meeting, it turned out that I became a hand-me-down item at their enterprise. The captain for his heroism and vigilance displayed during the Game of Parties was rewarded by the rise from the provincial backwoods to the capital city of Kiev. He did not hide his joy passing me as a stock-in-trade to his successor.
</p><p>The successor was a black-haired young man who had just graduated from some institute in Chernigov. The educational institution had a special   Historical Department there at which they were forging Party Cadres.
 After that Department you weren't sent to a village to work off your diploma, you got a job no lower than at some District Party Committee and then – grow up in your career to become a Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU, if your liver can cope with the amounts of alcohol on the way  and you've got a felicitous gift of assuming,  pliably and aptly, the right position under current leadership.
 </p><p>But not everyone was up to graduating that Department.
 Two students from the Philological Department at the NGPI got transferred there, and a month later they blew off all the career prospects and came back.
 The discipline at the special Department was like that in a cadet school. With the lecturer entering the classroom, you had to stand at attention, otherwise the group headman, also a student, would get at you like a construction battalion <em>pheasant</em> at a newly drafted <em>salaga.</em>
 And in the hostel, everyone kept strict to the rules and peeking after anyone else to catch pants down and knock on them. After all, there were district committees and District Committees, one might be in a muddy district center, while another in the capital city.
 A trite example of the struggle for survival – the more competitors you outlive, the harder it is to outlive you…
</p><p>That young black-haired KGB man had a long sheepskin coat and did not inquire about the price of mine. And he was much more mobile than the promoted captain or, maybe, the upstart hadn't yet grown lazy. Anyway, the secret meetings with me, he arranged at various city institutions.
 For instance, in ZAGS closed after a working day or in the Tourism Bureau. One time it was in an empty apartment on the fourth floor of a five-story building, not far from the main square.
 To that meeting, he brought along his new boss. Once upon a time, a male with the looks of that boss was stamped as "an interesting man" – gray hair in a clean cut above a youthful, well-tanned, face; a European gloss was felt at once.
 I don't know what for he was transferred from Hungary to the provincial backwoods of Nezhin, where he got interested in a rat whose finking helped his predecessor in the promotion to Kiev. However, I couldn't serve a springboard for him either. Enough was enough; I had got thoroughly fed up with that shit.
 </p><p>My invariable reports to the black-haired KGB young man, that the current student youth was an amorphous mass, indifferent to anything except for the present stock of lard in their "torbas", were almost bringing him to tears. The playful times of gamey gossip were over, I unilaterally stopped narking on my co-students.
 But he had so irrepressible desire to dig something out, that even send his secret collaborator to Room 72, in case I was a double agent, and kept an underground printing house under my bed.
 </p><p>Of course, that <em>secsot</em> did not introduce himself as a rat with the pseudonym "Vova", yet I still figured it out.
 Would a normal student from the Physics and Mathematics Department ask me for help with his English? With all the “pro” and “cons” secured by my image? Hooey!
 The shammer drove a fool about living in the same hostel as me.
 Okay, dude! No problem!
 </p><p>So, here he comes.
 I hospitably encourage him to take a seat on a freshman's bed and call the exercise number from the textbook he’s brought along, and he starts doing the exercise.
 So I can return to the table with the players in the already started "pool" of Preferans around it.
 And what will he sneak into his notebook for his report to the KGB man: "seven in spades", "trick", "pass", "miser"?
 At those carefree times, the Ministry of Health has not yet started to print its warning on cigarette packs and the malignant deadly tobacco smoke kept filling Room 72 with its tumbling, slowly whirling layers.
 The non-smoker martyr of a rat learned it from his severe exposure, that stool-pigeoning was hazardous for health. It took him just two visits to make sure that, yes, the student body was hopelessly amorphous and miserably supine – beggarly two kopecks for a trick.
</p><p> But once the young KGBist dictated me a telling on Zhomnir.
 There was nothing compromising in the text though, just that on such and such a day, at such and such an hour Zhomnir was coming out from the Language Laboratory.
 Well, the Language Laboratory was not a safe house and contained just the laboratory assistant at her desk, and a swarm of freshmen behind the glass doors in the booths, parroting the tape-recorded texts "Meet the Parkers" from the headphones on their heads. Some absolutely inappropriate place for disseminating of the Ukrainian nationalism.
 </p><p>I guess, the dictation was done just in case, after the KGB man found out that I was visiting Zhomnir at home to discuss my translations for "Translator", which I never cut ties with.
 Such a piece of paper could always come handy: "Some familiar hand, isn't it, Alexander Vasilyevich?"
 </p><p>My final mission was making friends with an American.
 There was a ten-day USA Agricultural Exhibition in Kiev, so I was instructed to visit it and make friends with at least someone from their staff.
 I took Slavik with me and we whizzed by a local train to Kiev, and there to the grounds of the Republican Veh-Deh-eN-Kha with the exhibition held in a huge hangar.
 </p><p>A live American was then a rare phenomenon, so at the exhibition, you could hardly squeeze and tolter through the crowd denser than that to the Lenin Mausoleum in the Red Square in Moscow, or at the traveling menagerie in Konotop on a Sunday afternoon.
 On entering the hangar you saw the huge portrait of the US President Jimmy Carter with best wishes to the Soviet people, and the crowd carried you farther alongside the shiny barriers with compartments on both sides – farm tractors, machines, pictures of happy rural life.
 In one small section there stood a dummy pig, some nice creature, with large flowers painted all over it, in the style of  "Yellow Submarine" cartoon by The Beatles.
 And next to the ornamented piggy there stood a girl, but alive. Not my style though, if not aware that it’s an American you wouldn't waste another glance at her.
 </p><p>So, she stood by and kept squeaking like a clockwork, "This is a piglet! This is a piglet!"
 But her staring eyes, long since stunned, dim, and glassy, turned kinda swoony slugs and swam over all that rumbling crowd that flowed past her for hours, like some f-f..er..I mean, flooding Niagara Falls without the tiniest splash of response to her words from the thrumming waves of strange faces.
</p><p>I pitied her and slowed down by her stall, "Hey, girl,” says I, “Call it <em>porosyonok."</em>
 </p><p>"This is a piglet! This is a piglet!"
 </p><div id="span"><p>(...at that time the two great nations were not prepared for a dialogue yet...)
 </p></div><p>I and Slavik went out of the hangar and sparked in the dank spring wind of the Republican Veh-Deh-eN-Kha. When back in Nezhin, I reported to the black-haired that those Americans were too introvert.
 He realized that both "introvert" and "amorphous' stuff was not the right building-blocks for  his career  and grew sad…
</p><p>That mission turned the last one because soon after I dug a hole for myself to fall into...
 The black-haired KGBist really fretted me already with his importunate demands to write a report and not to just play with the word order. And there popped up something to make him happy without harming innocent civilians...
 In the institute reading hall, on the second floor of the New Building, I was leafing through a biography of Bogdan Khmelnitsky when on one of the pages I saw a mark in pencil: "Bogdan Khmelnitsky is a traitor to the Ukrainian people". I mentioned it in my next report to the KGB.
 </p><p>The guy was delighted – calling the initiator of the Ukraine and Russia reunion a traitor was visibly steaming with the Ukrainian nationalism. "On which page?"
 </p><p>"Well, somewhere in the middle."
</p><p> So, they arrested the book, found the subversive page and, at the following meeting, "But it was you who wrote that."
</p><p> "What?!."
</p><p> "The hand is yours, that's what. No use of denying. You better admit." And he started to intimidate me with full-scale expertise.
 Two weeks later, he explained that the letter "a" in the pencil inscription was very like to mine but a little different; so the graphologist told him. Yet—which is characteristic—he did not even apologize.
 </p><p>In general, I, like, got offended and stopped to turn up for the loathsome dates, no matter how diligently he flashed his semaphore newspaper. And at chance meetings in the city transport, I was cutting him dead with a disinterested indifference of a stranger.
 He seemed to understand that such a secret collaborator is as beneficial as two aces in the kitty when playing a miser at Preferans, and pissed off.
 So the KGB archives ceased to accumulate the reports with my handwriting signed "Pavel" of which I never regretted. My affair with the organs was anything but a happy one... </p>
