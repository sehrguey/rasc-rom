 <h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> My Universities (part two)<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>To come up for air from the clutches of the Ukrainian language, aka <em>mova,</em> I asked Zhora Ilchenko for one of the books he brought from India and started translating it into Russian.
Not a too thick book, some two hundred pages, authored by Peter Benchley, a writer in the third generation, that is both his grandpa and his daddy earned their living in the same trade. The book was titled <em>The Jaws,</em> about a shark-cannibal. On the whole, a professionally mixed vinaigrette – a little scrap of everything: bitten-off limbs, a love triangle, the mafia looming in the background.
True, the final scene of the shark's assassination was unscrupulously copied from <em>Moby Dick,</em> but who nowadays reads Melville?
</p><p>While rendering all that in Russian, I finished off a pack of thick copybooks.
The translation was completed in Konotop, in winter. So, it was the night from Saturday to Sunday, or else during the winter holidays...
The clock on the kitchen wall was showing some of the small hours. Putting the final period, I draw it as big as half-page – I wanted to finish off the ink in the ball-pen but it never ended.
Then I turned off the light and lay on the folding coach-bed in the living room behind whose two windows, there stood a whitish night dimly fluoresced with the snow. And it seemed that the night was leaning heavily against the window panes, just about to break in.
I tried to get asleep as soon as I could, for I never liked horror movies.
</p><p>By spring, my sister Natasha read those notebooks, and then leased them to someone else and they dissolved, leaving no trace, in nowhere…
</p><p>Well, all that's fine; but when about the most important?
</p><p>Eera…
</p><p>My relationship with her at the reunion stage can be characterized with just a single word – "torture". Trying real hard, one might extend it – "torturing torture".
Firstly, taking our relationship up again in Nezhin ran into a number of stumbling blocks.
</p><p>Why resume? But I was in love, damn it! It was love at first sight on that tread through the wet stalks of corn. And it should be kept in mind that, by my nature, whenever I fall in love it is forever.
I mean, falling in love, then falling out for just to fall in again, and out... no, such bouncing is not for me. Yes, my father was right applying to me his winged byword about my Laziness-Mommy being born a moment before me.
</p><p>Besides, the return to Nezhin fully confirmed the accuracy of my choice – with all the multifacedness, multinosedness, multileggedness, multibreastedness of the assortment, Eera was the second to none.
Starting with the clothes: in the era of totalitarian shortages, she managed to look dressed in a soigne European way, as in the movies of Italo-Franco-German production.
Turning to the undergarments: I've never seen so delicately feminine lingerie in my life.
Getting over to the item of most vital importance, the body itself: such bodies as hers, I saw only in the bathroom at the Object, when sitting next to the fire burning in Titan and considering the Goddesses, the Dryads, and the Nymphs of Hellas in the black-and-white illustrations interspersing<em> The Myths and Legends of Ancient Greece.</em>
</p><p>However, her gait was quite modern – the German-like resolute pacing coupled with the sway of her right hand.
She had a round face with high cheekbones and a nose with a weeny hump, wide, yet not turned out, lips. The light brown hair of the ideal length, in my favorite hairstyle.
I liked to watch her, approaching along the street that lead up to the Old Building, and to follow how in the distant circle of her face the fuzzy, as in the full moon, lines began to merge into my Eera's features.
But all that came about not immediately...
</p><p>At the beginning, Eera trusted in the sinister prognosis by Olya. And even Vera, who had so sympathetically been preparing the bed in Bolshevik for two of us to bathe in the fiery stream of  lascivious carnal pleasures, dubiously shrugged and hesitated – O, my, they tell so heinous things about him!
That's why our initial encounters in Nezhin didn't look encouraging at all. I even started to suspect that all that happened between us in Bolshevik was just a "collective-farm affair" of a teacher's daughter that used me. So, I pissed off.
</p><p>After some time, a group-mate of Eera, Anna, came to the Hosty with the errand from Eera who waited for me in the room of their Department hostel, in the main square.
I followed the messenger cursing on the way my shameful lack of the most elementary male pride…
</p><p>Eera was lying on one of the beds, for some reason without a sweatshirt, wearing only her skirt and beautiful, as always, lady's undergarment. The girls whose room it was tactfully left us alone.
I sat down on the bed next to her, doing my best  to conceal how captivated I was by the beauty of her torso and the strangely pale face.
</p><p>She said that she had had a pregnancy, and a young surgeon-gynecologist made the abortion at his home, under anesthesia.
Is abortion done under anesthesia? At home? Young?
</p><div id="span"><p>(...certain thoughts are better never be thought at all...)
</p></div><p>Feelings of guilt and compassion only added to my love. I couldn't help it, I put my arms around her shoulders and, lifting her from the pillow, pressed to my chest.
"I love you, Eera. You always know that I love you."
</p><div id="span"><p>(...and again I run into my being born at the wrong time.
I behave like an ancient Greek from the times when the birth control was females' responsibility.
</p><p>And in the modern enlightened age, the weaker sex has already saddled us and mounted, while still pretending to be weak...)
</p></div><p>The start-up misunderstandings (thanks to the kind care of her girlfriends), were further aggravated by unwanted predicaments at establishing normal sexual relations at the first stage of our love affair.
Not because of being short of favorable conditions for having sex, on the contrary, when Eera visited Room 72, my freshman-cohabitants, on their own accord, went to the first floor of the hostel to click the TV channels in the hall with the box, or sit over a bottle of lemonade in the refreshment room.
The problem had deeper roots...
</p><p>Not right away, but I noticed that after our having a sex Eera got in a plaintive mood, and on the way from the Hosty to her home she spoke of sad things...
How sadly was the wind dragging the autumn leaves across the stadium, visited to say goodbye to track athletics, because of a ligament injury after two years of training...
How sad it feels, when at a festive table your parents got so absorbed in an agitated discussion of who was more right or wrong, that they do not notice you taking already the third plate from the table, and detachedly letting it fall to the floor over the scattered splinters of the first two – snap! – before mom and daddy wake up and finally turn to you…
</p><p>The further, the sadder. The mood changes got substituted by undisguised sabotage!
How else to classify it, if at having a sex your partner wriggles out from under you?
It took me a hell of a lot of efforts to elicit the reason for such an unconventional behavior...
Well, because she felt something like an urge for uncontrollable urination.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...long live to our Soviet education system – the best system in the world!
It couldn't maim the village schoolkids to such a degree though. They were saved by direct observation of the natural facts of life. A village girl would figure out at a glance what namely you were rolling upon her with.
But the luckiless city dwellers?.
</p><p>In one of the color illustrations concluding the school textbook on Anatomy, there was a partial image of  penis modestly hidden in between the intestines, out-poured from the belly on the general scheme of internal organs.
Those appended pictures were studied by the pupils on their own because during the academic year the class managed to reach only the middle of the textbook.
</p><p>Now, how could the unfortunate daughter of teacher know the difference between orgasm and urination?..)
</p></div><p>I'm far from stating that the problem was solved because of my persistent requests to trust her own body, which was wiser than her. In any case, she gave up wriggling out…
</p><p>All those painful crises in the relationship called for general relaxation, and restoration of the dented self-esteem. These factors led to the emergence of Sveta, who also lived in the Hosty, and Maria, who did not live there but came on occasional visits, and more oftener I went to spend a night at her place...</p>
