<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Ivory Tower<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>
The letter of advice on my detention reached SMP-615 a month or two later.
I already forgot about it when the new boss called me from the construction site and demanded to write an explanatory.
He obviously made his mind to use the situation to full advantage, and in a week the trade-union committee met to consider my personal case.
</p><p>With the autumn cold setting in, I attended the meeting with my raincoat and hat on.
</p><p>The new boss, in his jacket and tie, began to expound my transgressions.
The freshest of them, attested by the paper from the militia, was my violating directives of the party and government on a park bench. That's how I disgraced SMP-615 in the eyes of the public and the authorities! How long to tolerate?!
</p><p>However, I chose the position of an observer and to all rhetorical questions answered with a shrug of my left shoulder under the raincoat...
</p><p>And my contemptuous attitude to the management?! Here, if you please – an explanatory written in verse!
From the stack of papers on the desk in front of him, the new boss picked up one sheet and shook it in the air.
</p><p>...wow! I did not know there was accumulated such a dossier  on me…
</p><p>And look at another sample here! The reminder written by me to the trade-union committee (he read it up), "Three months ago I applied for upgrading my bricklayer category.
However, till now the qualification commission of SMP-615 neither raise an eyebrow nor move their horns."
</p><p>The trade-union committee burst in laughter, the new boss, obedient to the herd instinct, also grunted  not understanding though what  funny was about it...
</p><p>Besides, it's simply dangerous to be next to me because I was putting an arm under the slab!.
</p><p>And that’s a fact.
On that day there were four of us: the overseer Karenin, the carpenter Ivan, the crane operator Vitalya and I.
The sun was glaring upon the March snow around the construction site where we were starting a new apartment building.
The foundation blocks had been laid in the pit since autumn, and then, throughout the winter, Ivan's job was to look after them. From 8 to 5.
 He was coming to turn  on the heater in the trailer, and watched  the silent white snowdrifts outside the window, or  considered the cut-outs of cute beauties from girlie magazines that he glued on all the walls to give his hands at least some job...
On that March day, he became my hand.
</p><p>The task was simple – to lay four courses of bricks in the short wall of the future staircase-entrance and install a stump of a slab over the future doorway to the basement.
Standing on the trestle between the foundation blocks, I raised two short corners and started laying courses under the<em> shoorka</em> to finish the stump’s prop of a wall.
It was a half-hour task, no more, while  the working day ended in an hour plus.
</p><p>However, Vitalya, the crane operator, was impatient to climb down from his perch in the cab of the tower crane and play cards with Ivan till five. So he shouted from above to the carpenter to hook the concrete slab stump intended for the installation.
The stump's one side would rest onto the blocks of the traverse wall, the other side would be supported by the readied corners of the unfinished wall. They'll lap it up! And the remaining gape between the bearing corners would be filled sometime after, in the process of construction.
</p><p>I tried to bring it home to Ivan, that now it was the most convenient moment for finishing the started wall. Later, to fill the gape left under the stump, the bricklayers would not have the trestle under their feet. Let him better bring the mortar and I'd finish it in fifteen minutes, working under such favorable conditions.
Yet, Vitalya for Ivan was a closer pal than logic, so he went and hooked the stump as told.
</p><p>The crane operator raised the load, turned the beam and rolled the tower crane along the railway, carrying the stump to me for insertion as he planned.
He yelled from his cab to quickly spread mortar on the corners of the unfinished wall otherwise he would drop it just as is, on dry bricks – they'll lap it up!
Instead of mortar, I put my arm on a brick corner so that he did not fulfill his intention.
</p><p>Vitalya poured hectic curses from his birdhouse in the height, rang the crane bell without interruption, and kept closing in on the arm, with the load.
In general, it was a frontal attack of two fighter planes against each other: he who yields was nothing but a snotty chicken.
</p><p>When the concrete stump neared the arm to about a meter, overseer Karenin awoke from watching the breath-taking battle of two aces and yelled to Vitalya to take the load aside.
And there it hung while I finished the wall the way it was right.
Overseer Karenin stood on the blocks above my head and asked, "Why did you do it, Sehrguey? He's crazy enough to crush your arm. You'd be a cripple."
</p><p>"Karenin, my whole life is crushed. All that remains is just my work. I don't want them make a snot of it."
</p><p>"Where?" asked Ivan standing on the other wall of blocks behind my head. "What's the talk about crushin'?"
</p><p>"He means it was his written fate from birth," overseer Karenin explained to him.
</p><p>I was finishing the last course of bricks, like, busy, but I could not let the erudite conversation go without me, "May his hand wither, to that writer!"
</p><p>Karenin and Ivan instantly got silent, the overseer somehow shrank and turned his eyes aside.
And exactly that very moment, squinting my eyes in the rays of the sun descending to the horizon, and spreading mortar for insertion of the slab stump onto the finished wall,  I  for the first time thought that the particulars of our lives were defined and occurring the way as we recount them in our later life.
And it doesn't matter to whom and whether in gossip or writing...
</p><div id="span"><p>(...it's scary!
As it turns out, by that spontaneous curse I wished my own hand to wither away?!.
Why? It is so unfair!
</p><p>..shut up!. who are you to make complaints of unjust treatment?.
how else could I show that cheeky puppeteer in his made in Germany sleeping bag that I’m not a servile marionette neither a tool to go by his drowsily scintillating blabber meant for reconstructing the past beyond his reach?.
</p><p>I’m not sure if you can get it though, the good news that at least I can follow myself...
however, I’d better shut up now for not to overstrain our brain.
</p><p>...moreover, if not for this sleeping bag my story might very easily and more than once have ended in the nameless river at the Object...)
</p></div><p>Ivan and I inserted the stump. Vitalya got down from the tower crane and still had time for playing cards with Ivan before we went to the road to meet and board on our Seagull.
I soon forgot the whole incident, however, the new boss did not omit to add it to the dossier…
</p><p>"And you all know as well as I do, how often they nab him to the psychiatric hospital... Yet, worse than anything else, he is a chronic violator of labor discipline. Three occurrences of absenteeism in only one year! That's why I propose to fire him for systematic absenteeism."
</p><p>That's right – two days to Moscow after the  train model for Andrey, and one day to the publishing house "Dnipro" in Kiev...
At the time of each of my violations, I fully realized that it was an act of absenteeism.
However, it was normal for a workman at SMP-615 to have a week of absenteeism, and a couple of champions had accrued up to twenty days, which fact I considered a guarantee of permissibility to skip three days, the grosser violators would serve a cover for my ass.
Yet, no go! The integrity of the labor discipline couldn't be bribed with a smartie's calculations!
</p><p>And now, after five consequential records in my workbook marking the gratitude for and appreciation of my labor achievements, on October 18, 1985, the head of personnel department of SMP-615, A. Petukhov, with that same beautiful handwriting wrote that I was fired on the strength of Article 40, for absenteeism without satisfactory excuse.
The participants in the meeting of the trade-union committee unanimously raised their hands in favor of the measure proposed by the new boss.
Afterward, some of them commented that such a result was exclusively my blunder, I should have stood up, and,   hat in  hand, humbly ask for mercy and then they would forgive me…
</p><p>Why did I maintain the role of a monitor to the end and did not make a speech in self-defense, pointing out the absenteeism of others, quite a few, and did not express my bitter regret for my wrong-doings?
I simply was fed up. The time had come to seek other grounds for the application of my experimentalism.
Not because of so was my plan though. As always, I remained just a tool, an operation-end man executing his orders. The time and Experimentalism were the decision-making bodies...
</p><p>Besides, another 100-apartment block was finished in summer. A bricklayer from our team, named Nina, a fat woman with a hairy birthmark on her cheek, got an apartment in it.
She entered SMP-615 a couple of months before the commissioning of the apartment block and, having received the apartment, quit the organization.
</p><p>I went to the personnel department and asked Petukhov about my progress in the queue for improving my housing conditions.
He answered I was number 35 in it.
</p><p>That's ridiculous! Six years before, I was 24th in the line!
</p><p>He replied with calligraphic roundness: since those times three bosses replaced each other, and he, personally, was not around when I got a job at SMP-615, so now my place in the list was thirty-fifth and no other data to refer to…
</p><p>Fare thee well, my beloved construction train! Farewell, our team!
I won't set on fire our trailer, even though my guitar, brought for celebrating Grinya's birthday, the next morning was not there…</p>
