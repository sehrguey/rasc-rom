<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, our new Mistress retained some confidence in me and a month later entrusted  with a verbal message for Seraphima Sergeevna in our former classroom.
</p><p>I knocked on the familiar door and recited the message to my first teacher, who was sitting at her desk facing the new growth of first-graders. She thanked me and then asked to close the upper window leaf, through which droughts got in whenever someone opened the door.
</p><p>I readily climbed onto the windowsill and, standing on tip-toes, reached out and slammed shut the vicious leaf. The mission done and, rather than to kneel back on the sill and then lie on it with the stomach, I just jumped down on the floor.
</p><p>The jump turned out classy deft, and full of pride I strutted out of the silent classroom past the delight and reverence in the eyes of the small ones at their desks.
 How could I have thought those first-graders on a visit to my kindergarten group were so unreachably grown up? Arrogant swaggers!.
</p><p>At home, we already had a TV set in which announcers read the news against the background of the Kremlin walls and towers, and hockey players rushed from one goal to the other at the European and World Championships.
 There were eagerly awaited for programs of Kinopanorama, and the Club of Jolly and Inventive, and, of course, movies!
</p><p>I would never have supposed that there could be a film longer than two sequels. The four sequels of “Bombard the area I’m in!” became an eye-opener.
 Only I did not like Italian cinema, because when Marcello Mastroianni mentioned possible abortion and I inquired what that word meant, our neighbor, auntie Paulinna, laughed out loud and Dad ordered me leave the parent’s room because that movie was not meant for children…
</p><p>The arms race took place not only in the TV box but in our boyish life as well. We reached the stage of using sophisticated weaponry: crook pistols, crook rifles.
</p><p>There’s hardly any need in a detailed explanation what a slingshot is, however, I’d like to point out that there are two types of slingshots: for shooting pebbles, and for shooting crooks.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…pebble-shooters are a lethal weapon, in the hungry post-war years in Stepanakert, the boys were knocking sparrows down from the trees for their meal…)
</p></div><p>Crook-shooting slingshot is almost a toy made of aluminum wire and a round rubber band for aircraft-modeling (instead of rubber straps cut out from a gas mask for pebble shooters).
The non-lethal slingshots shoot with a small piece of aluminum wire bent into a narrow arc-like crook. Catching the rubber band within the crook’s bend, pull the band and let the missile go. It doesn’t kill but it is felt alright, bad news if the crook hits the eye.
</p><p>Now, if instead of the slingshot the round rubber band is fixed upon a piece of planed plank and you pull the crook along its even surface, the accuracy of the hit grows exponentially because the crook takes off the firm guide. The rest, cutting out of that piece of plank a submachine gun or a pistol, is up to you.
</p><p>At the point on the plank side to which the readied crook is pulled, you adjust the trigger from the same aluminum wire strung crosswise to keep the crook in place until you pull the trigger. The pressure for holding the cocked up crook originates from a rubberband, like that in underpants, stretched taut from the trigger to the screw in the downside of the planed plank.
</p><p>The boys armed with such weapons do not run about yelling “ta-ta-ta!” as in War-Mommy. They leave those naive games for kindergarten kids and go down into basements and start hunting each other in the dark.
 Metallic “dzink!” of a crook against the cemented floor, or the wooden walls, suggests that the enemy is near and opened fire at you. But securing the position in the pit above the floor at the end of the corridor, you are as safe as in an impregnable bunker. You have to just sit tight up there and send crooks to the sound of stealthy steps, and if you hear “ouch!” from the dark, then you have targeted him okay…
</p><p>In autumn, they finished construction of the five-story apartment block across the road surrounding Block.
 The tenants were moving into their flats while deep down, in the endless basement corridors of so big a building (the first of that height and size at the Object), there unfolded unprecedented combat actions with the employment of crook weapons of all types.
</p><p>Initially, the huge underground basement was illuminated with electric bulbs placed rarely but evenly, they lived but a short life: long-range crook shots burst them up, one by one, into fine splinters.
 Perhaps, the only drawback of the crook weapons was their almost complete noiselessness. For real self-assertion, you need your arms to do some major bangs…
</p><p>Life just cannot stand still, it has to flow. Where to? The direction conforms to the dearest dreams of those swimming in the flow, sort of…
</p><p>More and more often, the evening quietude in the Courtyard got disrupted with sharp snaps alike to gun reports because the boys had armed themselves with <em>peelikkalkas</em> but I, as usual, straggled behind the advanced trends in the flow of social life, which made me beg for instructions to manufacture a <em>peelikkalka</em>.
</p><p>Take 15 cm. length of a narrow section (0.5 cm.) copper tube and bend it in the shape of letter L. The foot of the resulting L is flattened with a hammer.
</p><p>Through the remaining orifice, pore a small amount of molten lead into the tube to form a smooth leaden bottom at the bend point.
</p><p>Find a thick long nail reaching the leaden bottom and still sticking out from the tube for at least 5 cm. and bend the nail at 4 cm. from its head (you’ve got another L now).
</p><p>Insert the nail into the tube (the contraption resembles the left bracket “[”, or right bracket “]”, depending on your point of view) and as a result, you have a working piston-cylinder shebang.
</p><p>Connect the bent nail head and the flattened tube foot using a rubber band, like that used in underpants, now the whole construction looks like a small bow and your <em>peelikkalka</em> is ready.
</p><p>Pull the nail halfway out from the tube, the tension of the band forces the nail rest against the copper wall of the tube at the point to which you pulled the nail out.
</p><p>Squeeze the <em>peelikkalka </em>in your palm, the band pressed to the tube makes the nail slide inside and sharply hit the leaden bottom. So much for a trial blank shot.
</p><p>Now, it remains only to load the firearms, for which purpose the nail is fully taken out and the tube loaded with scrapings of sulfur from a couple of match heads.
</p><p>Insert the nail back, cock it up with the band and “Hello, world!” with a live shot from your weapon. Bang!…
</p><p>In the evening dark, the splash of flame shooting out from the tube orifice looks quite impressive.
 On the whole, it’s the same principle as in toy pistols with paper pistons, yet distinctly enhanced in decibels…
</p><p>On learning the theory, I wanted to manufacture a <em>peelikkalka </em>of my own, but Dad did not have a copper tube of the right size at his work.
</p><p>Still and all, I had it, probably, one of the boys gave me an odd one of his.
</p><p>You can't deny that in an extra-curricular way, a schoolboy gets better training for real life…
</p><p>As for mainstream schooling, our class was moved to the one-story building in the lower part of the school grounds, about a hundred meters from the principal building. Apart from our classroom, there were a couple of workshop rooms for Handicraft lessons equipped with vices and even a lathe in one of them. Because the school curriculum had more important subjects, that room was rarely open, two or three days a week to accommodate the grades visiting our territory.
</p><p>Learning on the outskirts of the school grounds had lots of advantages.
 During the breaks, you could have crazy races in the corridor without the risk of stumbling into some patrolling teacher as in the main building.<br>
 Besides, the teachers entered our class no sooner than some self-appointed sentinel or two of ours, playing outside, would race in with the announcement which subject was heading to us from up there. And a look-out guard was simply the must for not to be caught at bullying a socket in the classroom wall into whose holes with 220 V we stuck the legs of radio-electronic resistances. In the resulting short circuit, the resistance would burst and spit around indignant sparks of blinding flame.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…now I’m just bewildered why none of us had ever got electroshocked. It seems, the mains sockets in the room were too human…)
</p></div><p>Life was changing in our house too.
 The Zimins family left when Stepan was made redundant because Nikita Khrushchev, when on the post of the major ruler of the USSR, promised the Western countries drastic cuts in the contingent of the Soviet Army reducing it to the meager twenty millions of servicemen. Soon after that, he was made to retire, yet the new ruler kept the promise true and the reduction policies affected even our Object.
</p><p>Besides the Zimins, the tenants from the apartment beneath us left also. Their grown-up daughter Julia presented us, three children from the upper floor, with her album of matchbox stickers collection.
</p><p>At those times matchboxes were made not of cardboard with printed pictures on it, but of very thin, one-layer, plywood covered with taut blue tissue upon which they mounted one or another sticker portraying the famous ballet dancer Ulanova or some sea animal, or a hero astronaut in it. People collected matchbox stickers just like the post-stamp hobbyists, only, first, you had to peel them off a box soaked in water and then, of course, to dry up.
</p><p>Julia’s collection was subdivided into sections: sports, aviation, Hero Cities, and so on. Surely, all three of us were delighted with so generous a gift and we stepped in her shoes at keeping the picturesque hobbyhorse…
</p><p>In place of Yura Zimin, another Yura became my friend who had a different family name, yet, like the previous Yura, Yura Nikolaenko was also a neighbor, more distant though, who lived not on the same landing but in the same Block.
</p><p>As the snow filled the forest, we ventured out there in search of foxholes or, at least, to catch an odd hare. We had pretty good chances of success because we were joined by a lowlander-boy who brought a dog living in the yard of their wooden house. Only he was too greedy to share the linen rope tied to the dog’s collar and yanked it himself.
</p><p>In the forest though, the dog began to drag him forward and backward over the snowdrifts with lots of hare footprints. Yura and I were running behind not to miss out on the moment of catching a hare.
</p><p>Then we noticed that the dog was paying no attention to the hare footprints but constantly sniffing for something else. Finally, he started to excitedly dig into a tall snowdrift.
 Anticipating that the dog would dig out a fox burrow whose scent he nosed through the snow, we armed ourselves with sticks to meet the beast.
 However, from under the snow, the dog pulled out a big old bone, and we stopped hunting…
</p><p>In the winter holidays, many children of my age were invited to a neighboring corner house in the Courtyard, where some newly arrived tenants celebrated the birthday of their daughter, my future classmate. She looked like Malvina from <em>The Golden Key</em> tale, only her hair was neither blue nor curly, but straight.
</p><p>After the guests finished all of the lemonade on the big table, the beautiful girl shared her memories of the place she lived before, where she was, like, Queen of the Courtyard and the boys living there were her pages, sort of…</p>
