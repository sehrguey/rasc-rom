<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>And while I was lying on my folding bed midst the battlefield of Austerlitz, life was not standing still. My sister and brother kept bringing news that the garbage enclosure had been pulled down to be replaced with a shed. And the field between the shed and the Bugorok-Knoll got turned into a skating rink! As big as all that field leveled by the solitary bulldozer back in autumn. Yes, there arrived a fire-engine, they dropped the hoses on the ground and leaked tons of water. It’s a real skating-rink now! And they were lending out skates at the shed! You could come and borrow skates or, optionally, bring your own and go skating!
</p><p>I did not want to lag behind life, and promptly recovered. Still, I was late. They were no longer lending skates at the shed, and you had to bring some with you. The benches in the shed were still in place, so you could sit down and put on the skates you had brought, leaving your felt boots under the bench or in a locker if there remained any vacant one, and go skating.
</p><p>As it turned out, there were two sheds, side by side, and two doors upon a high wooden porch. The door on the right led to the locker-room, and the other to the warm-up room equipped with the electric skate grinder and a stove made of a wide iron barrel.
</p><p>The hot fire crackled in the stove to warm your frozen hands or dry up your mittens. You had to look out though to take your mittens off the stove in time or they'd stink with singed wool they're knitted of. Yak!
</p><p>No words could ever describe my desire to become a skater. How deliciously crunched the ice under the skates! And you didn’t run, but flew like a winged swift shooting ahead of the crispy crunch of your steely blades!.
</p><p>I started learning with double-bladed skates, which had strings to tie them to the boots, and I was laughed at for using such kindergarten playthings. “Snegoorki” came in their place, the round-nosed skates of one blade each, but also with the strings for tying. And nothing came out with them either, no flight, no joy, just some odd iron pieces on my felt boots. Finally, Mom brought from someplace real “half-Canadians” riveted to the shoes of their own.
</p><p>With those real skates hung over my shoulder, I hurried to the locker room at the skating rink. I put them on and went out on the ice. All I could get there was an awkward hobbling back and forth. The skates did not want to stand evenly, they kept falling in or out, twisting my feet so painfully. I had to return back to the locker-room walking the snowdrifts around the skating rink, where dense snow kept the skate blades upright which prevented them from breaking my tortured ankles out.
</p><p>The last attempt occurred in the evening after Dad came home from work and had his supper. At my request, he tightly laced the “half-Canadians” making them one with my legs.
</p><p>I went out and clattered down the stairs holding onto the railing. From where the railing ended  I walked to the entrance door with my hand to the wall. The outer wall of the house supported me on my way around the building. Farther on, there were auxiliary snowdrifts, but the road I had to cross fluttering my hands like a tightrope walker.
</p><p>At last, I got to the skating rink to see that tight lacing up brought no improvement, the skates again were breaking my feet in and out even though cinched by Dad.
</p><p> I stood there for some time, in pain and envy to the crowd of wing-footed ones happily rushing around me, before starting the endless hurtful way back.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…and never more in my life tried I to skate.
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="centered3 bold ital">“ Who’s born to creep – he cannot fly.”</span>…)
</p></div><p>On a clear day-off our landing neighbor, Stepan Zimin, suggested I join a ski walk he and his son Yura were taking in the forest, for which occasion Dad went down to our basement section and brought the skies.
</p><p>The leather loop in the middle of each ski allowed to slip  your felt boot's nose into it. The length of white rubber band, like that in underpants, tied with its both ends to the leather loop served an elastic noose about the felt boot heel not letting the ski slide off.
</p><p>Both Yura and I had a pair of ski poles each but Stepan went out with just skies on his feet but — whew! — he moved so nimbly without any poles! He glided down the Gorka and we followed, falling and getting up to glide farther on.
</p><p>Then we turned into the forest to the left from Recruit Depot Barracks and walked through the almost impenetrable thicket of the half-dried pine trees. We came across a couple of square holes in the deep snow there. Stepan explained they were dugouts during the war for the soldiers to live in.
  It was hard to believe because the war ended before my birth, which meant ages and ages ago, and in the course of so long a period all the trenches, and dugouts, and bomb-holes should have completely got leveled up and effaced from the earth…
</p><p>Never again Stepan went out for a ski walk, but I liked skiing and started to glide down the hillocks and knolls nearest to the road surrounding the two blocks.
And, of course, I volunteered to participate in the ski competition held at school, for which occasion, on the eve of the cross-country race, I asked Dad to change the worn-out rubber bands on the leather loops of my skies. He casually dismissed the problem saying they’re sturdy enough to hold on, and there’s nothing to bother about.
</p><p>The start was given from the glade where in autumn they pulled down the barrack on the Sunday of Collective Free Work. From the start point the ski track went into the forest and after zigzagging there for a couple of kilometers returned back; start and finish at the same point: two in one.
</p><p>Our group of fourth-and-fifth-graders was flagged off all at once, with a senior schoolboy running ahead of us so that we wouldn’t go astray among other ski tracks there.
 I was getting overtaken, and I was overtaking others yelling at them eagerly, “The track! The track!”, so that they would give way along the two narrow unbroken ski prints in the snow. And when they shouted “The track!” behind my back, I reluctantly stepped aside into the untrodden sticky snow, because that’s the rule.
</p><p>We ran, and we glided, and we ran again. Down one especially steep slope, we piled in over each other. I got from the pile one of the first and frantically rushed ahead, but some two hundred meters before the finish that meanie rubber band burst up and the ski slid off from my felt boot.
</p><p>Keeping back burning tears, I reached the finish in only left ski, driving the right one with kicks along its part in the ski track. The refs liked it, they laughed, but I, on coming home, burst into tears, “I knew it! I warned! I asked!”
</p><p>Mom went on at Dad, who wanted to talk back but couldn’t find what to say. The next day he brought from his work and fixed to the ski leather loops some elastic band of ivory color, as thick as a little finger.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…that fixture never failed, and even twenty-two years later the band served as it should.
</p><p>Skies, on the whole, are doggedly long-liver creatures…)
</p></div><p>With so reliable fasteners, on Sundays I was taking to the woods all day long.
The endless well-trodden ski track stretched from beyond anything to out of everything. At times, the ski track branched off and two tracks ran along, side by side.
</p><p>I liked the snappy  claps of skies against the ski track behind my back. On the way, I sometimes met single soldier-skiers enjoying their Sundays with their greatcoats left at the Regiment, flapping the loosened uniform shirts not girded with the army belt.
</p><p>The unbending ski track led to my favorite gliding grounds – a deep combe where the speed gained by the onrush down one slope took you up about one-third of the opposite one. I was delighted and proud that I could plunge like those solitary soldiers, although at times I had mind-blowing falls, especially at the jump ramp they built of snow for their jumps…
</p><p>One day I noticed a secluded ski track diverging from the mainline one which—as I gradually figured it out—was running along the former controlling clearing of Zona-Object-Detachment before its expansion.
</p><p>The fugitive ski track led me to an astounding ski-plunge slope in the depth of the thicket.
 Though the slope was grown with perennial fir-giants dictating an abrupt turn at its foot, yet, if you did not fall at that point, the plunge took you amazingly far  with the speed squeezing tears from your eyes and making repeat the drive over and over again…
</p><p>The next Sunday I almost did not fall at that tricky turn and rode the slope until very late, when the deep violet shadows began to trickle down from the dense branches of fir trees laden with the thick snow layer.
</p><p>Then all of a sudden, there came a strange feeling that I was not alone, that someone else was watching me from behind the backs of the mighty firs. At first, it was scary but having given heed to the benevolent silence of the trees around, I realized that it was him, the forest, friendly spying on me because we were one – me and the forest...
 The twilight deepened and I remembered that Block was more than two kilometers away.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…of course, I got home in the dark and bore the brunt of Mom’s displeasure, yet until now when remembering that  purplish winter twilight and the good-willed quietude of the forest, I know that I lived not just so... </p>
