<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Solitary Barge Hauler<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>My cheeky snubs to the judge at the people's court straightened out my chest, but not for long.
All slipped back into the same eternal rut: "O! Woe to me! What for? I loved so much! I was doing my best! Why me?"
The unanswerable questions took turns with the sticky, fondly meek, dream that one of these days Eera would come and everything would be fine again…
The fact, that by the divorce Eera had, with straightforward logic, cleared her way to further life without me around, did not diminish the longing for the unreachable, neither shooed off the hope that everything  will, somehow, become fine all the same…
</p><p>However, uninterrupted suffering is a pretty tiresome occupation and, gradually, I formed a firm opinion that the divorce had to be, after all, celebrated.
But in what way? I knew no rituals on the subject and could only improvise.
One thing was clear though, I needed a day not like all other days. And it was for such a day that I went to Kiev.
</p><p>The Indian summer that year transgressed all the limits of common sense and, even though it was the first week in November, I ventured there in my jacket. Taking into account the fall's depth reached in the calendar, the dark gray waistcoat went along with the jacket. It did not belong to any three-piece suit but was sewn back in my school years by that same sharp-nosed tailor in her shop next to the bus station...
Such was my rig (plus a shirt and pants) when I emerged from the metro station on Khreschatyk Street and moved slowly along its wide sidewalks grown with gorgeous chestnuts.
</p><p>I went down to Red Army Street cobbled with polished flagstones, and walked farther down its slope to the "Foreign Book" store to make myself the event-marking present, which caught my eye pretty long time ago, during the last year's business trip to the dairy reconstruction. On the way, I had to keep in check a nagging slight worry: what if they had already sold it?
However, I was almost sure and didn't get much surprised making out the bright red jacket of <em>Chamber's 20th Century Dictionary</em> on the same very shelf.
</p><p>The salesman, observing my festive outfit—from under the waistcoat, there also peeped the open collar of my faded red shirt—asked politely if I indeed would want that particular book.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...I was not surprised by his doubt – in that year of the then-current 20th century, not every folk could afford a book for 31 rubles 60 kopecks.
Except, of course, for the bricklayers celebrating their divorce...)
</p></div><p>I left the store with the thick volume tightly wrapped in their special lavender-colored packing paper. It had to be left in an automatic storage cell at the station.
Yet, how to get there? On the subway again? No, it was another kind of day. And I approached the curb with flocks of taxis shooting by…
From the station, I also went to "The Hunter" store, at the address given me by Grinya, who wanted some folding fishing rod from there.
</p><p>After the shopping spree and the subsequent storing of goods, there started the cultural part in the program.
That evening The House of Organ Music was filled with the sun shimmer over the sea waves in the pieces by Debussy. Bright sparkling notes in the ripples and splashes of waves dancing happily...
As I was a child, my father told me that at listening to such music people were supposed to draw some mental pictures to fit it. I never could follow his advice, the sounds overpowered all clever intentions leaving no space for anything else…
</p><p>In the post-concert twilight outside The House, the mid-autumn chill stired up my hunger. A taxi took me to the restaurant of "The Golden Wheat" hotel.
First, I tried to rent a room there for a sleepover, but the receptionist assessed my rig, incongruent with the season, as well as the absence of any luggage, and cut me off with their usual question below the belt: if I had booked a room. They  knew very well how to cope with vagrant freelancers.
</p><p>In the restaurant, to orient myself, I ordered a bottle of wine for a starter, and a geezer with a beret on his head immediately got seated on the chair opposite me.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...when there is a beret, but no briefcase by the man, then you are dealing with an electrician...)
</p></div><p>We did not have time to drink even a glass when a young blonde bozo landed at the third side of the table. For some unspecified reason, he began putting his fingers in the composition "I'll take your eyes out!" The electrician grew quiet under his beret...
My holiday program did not foresee any gladiatorial amusements, so I got up on my feet: "All right, young man. I leave this feast to you. Enjoy!"
</p><p>I went to the waiters, paid for the wine and left.
The blonde rushed after me to the lobby, but of the three glazed entrance vestibules, only one was opened to the porch, seeing me through lots of glass doors he, in his heated agitation, did not manage to choose the right one.
I waved my hand for a goodbye and went away…
</p><p>Sleeping in a waiting hall at the station would hardly add festiveness for the day. Another taxi took me to the hotel "Old Prague", which was the driver's choice.
The young receptionist there had also picked up the muchly chewed rag of beforehand reservation, yet suddenly turned merciful and found a room for me.
She warned though it was more expensive, which was understandable because on getting up there I found that, besides the room, there was also a hallway with a hatch in it.
</p><p>In the suite, I decided that it was enough for subjecting the fate to benevolence test with my attire, and used the phone to order  dinner to the room – fish with potatoes and wine, let it be white, please...
</p><p>Waking up late in the morning, I checked out and went for a walk about the city...
On the sidewalk near the Golden Gate, a blond young man ran panting by, apparently a part to the monad of the yesterday's boob, who got stuck in the labyrinth of glass vestibules at the Golden Wheat.
It looked like their whole monad would have a tough job at getting from the mess they got into with the feast I had generously thrown to them. But the fool ran into it himself…
</p><p>On the descent to Bessarabian Market, I decided it was time to dine, and turned into the restaurant "Leningrad".
In front of me, a group of Negroes entered the same place, however, I was anything but a racist and followed them. Still, I did not like the over-fat scruff of their file closer; some piece of obese Africa.
In the afternoon gloom of the restaurant, I could not see in what woodwork they managed to blend leaving me the only guest in the room.
</p><p>I ordered something "in the pot", so it was named on the menu. They brought potatoes mixed with meat and brown souse, but all that in a ceramic pot, as promised.
Eating from the pot was very uncomfortable and also too hot. But I guessed to pour a part of the steaming stuff into a plate on the table, and then was gradually adding to it from the pot.
</p><p>Before going out, I visited the empty quiet toilet by the restaurant    and left it a completely different person, not like the one who had been entering "Leningrad".
The lines by Ivan Franko were slowly swirling in the head:
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"One by one get severed the hobbles,<br>
Which kept  tied us to the life of the past..."
</p><p>And not only that.
The main difference between me getting in and me leaving the restaurant was the absence of the jacket, which I intentionally left  in the toilet hanging on a stall's door.
It was the wedding jacket in which I was registered as Eera's husband in the ZAGS of Nezhin.
Besides, it was the same one that survived my premature attempt at leaving it in the toilet of the restaurant "Bratislava" in Odessa. Perhaps, the time then was not ripe yet.
Was the act on the celebration program list? No, it  was sooner an impromptu inspiration, but I liked it.
</p><p>Eased and relieved, I lightly walked up Khreschatyk which was being prepared for the demonstration on the 7th of November.
The troops of the Kiev garrison were a-drilling their parade step to the gleeful marches by a brass band.
</p><p>Along the sidewalk, they had put endless board stands for spectators, just three steps  but very wide indeed, so that they would watch the demonstration and wave their hands in the show of approbation and jubilant joy.
Before the demonstration, there remained two more days and the steps were still empty. I walked along the middle one, clapping my heels against its thick planks, a man in his prime, in a red shirt under a gray waistcoat, and the sun rays vibrated through the branches of mighty chestnuts.
</p><p>I walked to the metro station and was ready again to face trenches, walls, and partitions.
 People do need holidays and brass bands so as to live on further…</p>
