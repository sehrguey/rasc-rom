<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Mom was a regular book reader in our family. Going to her workplace, she took them along to read during her shifts at the Pumping Station.
 Those books were borrowed from the Library of Detachment. (Yes, one more name because we lived not only in the Object-Zona-Mailbox but also in the Military Detachment number so and so.)
</p><p>The library wasn’t too far away, about one kilometer of walking. First, down the concrete road, until, at the Gorka’s foot, it was crossed by an asphalt road and, after the intersection, the concrete road disappeared replaced with the dirt-road street between two rows of wooden houses behind their low plank fences and narrow front gardens.
</p><p>The street ended at the House of Officers, but about a hundred meters before it there was a turn to the right, towards the one-story brick building of the Detachment’s Library.
</p><p>Sometimes, Mom took me with her down there and while she was exchanging her books in the back of the building, I waited in the big front room where instead of any furniture there hung lots of posters all over the walls.
</p><p>The central poster presented a cross-sectional drawing of the atomic bomb (because the full name of the Object we lived in was the Atomic Object).
</p><p>Besides the posters with the bomb anatomy and atomic blast mushrooms, there were other pictures about the training of NATO’s spies. In one of them, the spy who jumped from behind on a sentry’s back was tearing the soldier’s lips with his fingers. That picture made me creepy but I could not look away and only thought to myself, O, come on, Mom, please, change the borrowed books sooner.
</p><p>At one of such visits, I pluck up the heart to ask Mom if I also could borrow books from the library.
</p><p>She said that, actually, that was a library for adults but still led me to the room where a librarian woman was sitting at the desk on which the stacks of various thick books left only room for a lamp and the long plywood box beneath it, filled with the readers’ cards, and my Mom told her that she did not know what to do about me because I had already read the entire library they had at school.
</p><p>Since then I always went to the Detachment’s Library alone, without Mom. Sometimes, I even exchanged her books and brought them home together with the two or three for me.
</p><p>The books for my reading were scattered at ready over the big sofa because I read them in a scrambled way. On one of the sofa’s armrests, I crawled across the front line together with the reconnaissance group Zvezda with the mission to capture a German officer and, rolling over to the opposite armrest, I continued to gallop with White Chief of Mayne Reid among the cacti of Mexican pampas. And only the solid hardback volume of <em>The Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece</em> was, for some reason, read mostly in the bathroom sitting on a low stool with my back leaned against Titan the water-boiler.
</p><p>For such a messy lifestyle Dad handled me “Oblomov”, the lazybones whom he remembered from the lessons of Russian Literature at his village school…
</p><p>That winter was endlessly long and full of heavy snowstorms as well as the frost-and-sun intervals, and some quieter snowfalls.
</p><p>Starting for school, I left home at dusk as thick as the night dark. But one day it was thawing and on my way back from school when reaching the tilt between the Recruit Depot Barrack and Block, I marked a strange dark strip to the left from the road.
</p><p>There I turned and plowing the snow with my felt boots went to see what’s up. It was a strip of earth peeping out from under the snow, a patch of the thawed ground sticky with moisture.
</p><p>The next day the opening extended, and some visitor had left in it several blackened fir cones. And although in a day the frost strengthened its grip again and fettered the snow with a thick rind of ice, and then the snowfalls set in anew and left no trace of the thaw on the hillside, I already knew for sure that the winter would pass all the same…
</p><p>In mid-March, at the first lesson on Monday, Seraphima Sergeevna told us to put our dip pens aside and listen to what she had to say.
</p><p>It turned out that two days before, she went to the bathhouse together with her daughter, and when back home she noticed that her wallet had disappeared with all of her teacher’s salary. She was very upset together with her daughter, who told her it’s impossible to built Communism with thieves around.
</p><p>But the next day, a man came to their home, a worker from the bathhouse, who had stumbled there on the missing wallet and figured it out who could lose it the night before, and took it to her place.
</p><p>And Seraphima Sergeevna said that Communism would surely be built, and there’s no doubt about it. Then she also asked us to remember the name of that working man.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…but I have already forgotten it because “body gets smooth and memory  hazy” as it stands in the dictionary by Vladimir Dahl…)
</p></div><p>The Saturday bathed in the sun as warm as the spring sun can be. After school and the midday meal at home, I hurried outdoors in the Courtyard where there was a general Subbotnik in progress.
</p><p>People came out of the houses into the bright shining day and shoveled the snow from the concrete paths about the vast Courtyard. Bigger boys loaded the snow in huge cardboard boxes and sledded it aside on a pile where it would not be in the way.
</p><p>In the ditches along the road, they dug deep channels, cutting the snow with shovels and hoisting out entire snow cubes darkly wet at the bottom. And through those channels, dark water ran lapping merrily.
</p><p>So came the spring, and everything began changing every day…
</p><p>And when at school they gave us the yellow sheets with records of our grades, the summer holidays started, bringing about the everyday games of Hide-and-seek, Classlets, and Knifelets.
</p><p>For the game of Knifelets, you need to choose a level area and draw a wide circle on the ground.
 The circle is divided into sectors according to the number of players who, standing upright, throw a knife, in turn, into the ground that belongs to some of their opponents.
</p><p>If the hurled knife sticks in, the sector gets split up with the line drawn in the direction determined by  the stuck knife’s blade sides. The owner of the divided sector has to decide which part of it he wants to keep while the other slice becomes a part of the knife-thrower’s domain.
</p><p>A player stays in the game until they retain a patch of ground big enough to accommodate for their standing upon at least one foot but with no space even for that, the game is over for them and the remaining players go on until there stays just one. You win!
</p><div id="span"><p>(…quoting Alexander Pushkin: </p><p class="centered3 ital bold">“Tale is a lie, yet holds some hint as well as a lesson to learn…”
</p><p>When playing knifelets, all I felt was an overwhelming yen to win. And presently, I can’t help feeling amazed at how readily the whole world’s history gets covered by a simplistic game for kids…)
</p></div><p>And we also played matches, which is a game just for two.
 Each player sticks their thumb off their fist, inserts a match, kinda spacer, between their thumb tip and the middle joint of the index finger, and holds it tight. The matches are slowly pressed against each other, the pressure grows and the player whose match withstands it without breaking up becomes the winner.
</p><p>The same idea as in tapping Easter eggs against each other, only you don’t have to wait a whole year for the game which wasted more than one matchbox nicked from the kitchen at home.
</p><p>Or we just ran hither-thither playing War-Mommy, yelling, “Hurray!”, or “Ta-ta-ta!”, or “I’ve killed you!” But the killed did not want to fall and he shouted back, “Okay! I’m at death’s doorstep yet!” And for a long time after, he still kept running to-and-fro and ta-ta-taing before to slam, at last, that door behind himself and picturesquely collapse upon the grass.
</p><p>For taking part in War-Mommy you needed a machine-gun sawed from a plank piece. Yet, some boys played automatic weapons of tin, a black-painted store acquisition.
</p><p>Such machine-guns had to be loaded with special ammunition – rolls of narrow paper strips with tiny sulfur globs planted in them. When the spring trigger struck such a glob it clapped loudly, and the paper strip got automatically pulled replacing the burned lump with the following one…
</p><p>Mom bought me a tin pistol and a box of pistons – small paper circles with the same sulfur globs which had to be inserted manually for every separate shot. After the report, a tiny wisp of sore smelling smoke rose from under the trigger.
</p><p>One day when I was playing the pistol in the sand pile by the garbage enclosure, a boy from the corner house asked me to present the weapon to him, and I readily gave it away. Being a son of an officer, he, of course, needed and had more rights to it than me.
</p><p>Mom refused to believe that anyone would give his gun away to another boy just so casually. She demanded of me to confess the genuine truth about losing Mom’s present, yet I  stuck to my truth so stubbornly, that she even had to lead me to the apartment of that boy in the corner house.
</p><p>The officer started to rebuke his son, yet Mom said she was so sorry and asked to excuse her because she only wanted to make sure I did not lie…</p> <br>
