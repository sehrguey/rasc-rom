<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>Probably, I caught cold by the holidays’ end and started school later than my classmates because I could not get it what was happening the morning when I finally came to our classroom.
</p><p>The lessons had not begun yet and the newcomer Malvina-like girl appeared in the doorway right after me. Like all the schoolgirls at any grade in those times, she wore the compulsory uniform in Queen Victoria’s style – a dark brown dress with a white lace collar and a black apron on copious straps over all of her shoulders.
</p><p>Stepping into the room, she stopped expectantly. The next moment a multi-voiced hue and cry burst out, “The Cow of the Courtyard!”
</p><p>She dropped her school bag on the floor and, wrapping her arms around her head, ran along the aisle between the desks, while everyone else—both the boys and the girls—blocked her way, hooting and yelling something in her ears, and Yura Nikolaenko ran behind her and rubbed himself at her back, like dogs do, until she sat down at her desk and dropped her face into her hands.
</p><p>The mayhem ceased only when  the classroom was  entered by a teacher asking, “What’s going on here?”, she was perplexed no less than me.
</p><p>The girl got on her feet and ran out of the classroom without even picking her schoolbag up from the floor.
</p><p>The next day she never showed up and we had a class meeting attended, instead of her, by her father who was red in the face and shouting that we were a bunch of scoundrels and pinched his daughter by the chest. He demonstrated with his hands where exactly were applied the pinches.
</p><p>Then our Mistress spoke to the meeting that it was a disgrace for pioneers to stain themselves with goading their classmates the way we did because the Malvina-like girl was also a pioneer like all of us.
</p><p>And I felt ashamed even though I hadn’t pinched nor goaded anyone.
 The beautiful girl never more appeared in our class, probably, she was transferred to the parallel one.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…<span class="bold ital">”the crowd is a merciless beast…”</span>,  runs a line from Avetic Isahakian’s poem about Abu-Lala, which I learned very well even before reading it…)
</p></div><p>Individual cruelty is as ugly as  collective one.
 In spring I got another deep scratch when witnessing an example of maternal pedagogy.
</p><p>The empty afternoon Courtyard was entered, between our house and the corner building, by a woman heading to the buildings on the opposite side. Behind her, a six-year-old girl ran and sobbed holding her arm outstretched to the women and kept repeating the same words with the voice hoarse from her non-stop wail and cry, “Mom, gimme your hand! Mom, gimme your hand!”
</p><p>The rasping shrieks somehow reminded me of Masha’s screeching, when they came to slaughter her at Grandma Katya’s in Konotop.
</p><p>The woman never slowed down only time and again looked back to lash with a thin rod the girl’s outstretched hand. The kid would respond with a somewhat louder shriek but neither withdraw her hand nor stop crying, “Mom, gimme your hand!”
</p><p>They crossed the yard and went into their staircase-entrance leaving me beset with the unanswerable question – where could such fascist mothers be in our country from?.
</p><p>Between the left wing of the school building and the tall openwork fence of planks that separated the school grounds from the surrounding forest, there were located beds of the school agronomy lot.
</p><p>It’s highly unlikely that the beds of loam mixed with withered pine needles dropped from several pines left inside the school territory, could yield a crop of any sort. However, when they announced to our class that everyone should come to school on Sunday for turning dirt in the agronomy lot, I dutifully showed up at the appointed hour.
</p><p>The morning was overcast, so Mom even tried to talk me into staying home. Indeed, everything turned out just as she had predicted – not a single soul around. But maybe they would come yet?
</p><p>I hung about the locked school for a while, then bypassed the dismal agronomy lot and went down to the one-story building of our class plus the workshop in the lower part of the school grounds.
</p><p>Opposite the building, there was a squat brick warehouse with two gates locked as anything else in the empty school grounds whose silent stillness could even be felt as a tangible substance. However, no lock could impede climbing up to the roof of the warehouse from the steep hillock behind which made it not a big deal.
</p><p>The slight slant of the lean-to roof was covered with black roofing felt. I walked around the roof square to each of its corners, then looked back at the mute school. Still nobody. Okay, five minutes more and I’d breeze off.
</p><p>At that moment the sun peeped out through the clouds making the wait not so gloomy because I marked light, transparent, wisps of steam rising from the black roof here and there. “Aha, the sun heats it!” guessed I.
</p><p>What’s more, while drying up, the black felt began to develop streaks of dark-gray color, which widened, expanded, joined together and kept me enthralled with watching that gradual expansion of the solar possessions.
 I knew perfectly well already that no one would show up and I might just as well go home, yet let that stretch of wet roofing felt would also turn dry-gray making the Isle of Dry expand to the corner edge of the roof.
</p><p>I returned home by the midday mealtime and didn’t tell Mom that the sun had recruited me to the ranks of his comrades-in-arms…
</p><p>End spring, Dad was going fishing out of Zona and he agreed to take me along if I procure worms for bait. I knew some lavish spots for worm-digging and brought home a whole tangle of them in a rusty tin container from canned beef.
</p><p>We left very early in the morning and, near Checkpoint, two more men joined us with the same papers of permission to leave Zona till six in the evening. Beyond the white Checkpoint gate, we turned right and went through the forest.
</p><p>We were walking, and walking, and walking and the forest never ended. At times the footpath got near the edge of the woodland but then again took us back into the wilderness.
</p><p>I walked patiently because Dad had warned me even before sending after the warms there was a walk of eight kilometers, and I hastily answered then that it was okay with me, yes, I could do that. So I just walked on, though my fishing pole and the tin can with bait grew very heavy.
</p><p>Finally, we went out to a forest lake and the fishermen told it was the Sominsky which I couldn’t recognize though it was the lake where I once learned to swim.
</p><p>We walked along a grassy promontory at the end of which there was a real raft. One of the fishermen remained on the shore, and we three boarded the raft that was made of logs from deciduous trees with smooth green bark.
</p><p>Dad and the other fisherman pushed the raft off, stepped onto it and kept jabbing slowly the lake bottom with long poles until we got some thirty meters away from the shore. There we stopped and began fishing.
</p><p>The raft logs were not close to each other and through the gaps between them, there were seen the openwork traverse logs drowned in the pitch-black depth, so we had to move carefully.
</p><p>Our three fishing poles overhung three different sides of the raft. Fish struck pretty often though the catch was not as big as promised by the vigorous resistance to the pulled line, besides, you had to be very careful taking it off the hook because around their muzzles as well as on back fins there stuck out very prickly spikes.
</p><p>Dad said it was the ruff, and the fisherman added that the ruff was most delicious.
 Later, when we got ashore and cooked the soup in a pot hung over the fire I, of course, ate all of it but couldn’t decide how delicious it was because the steaming soup was way too hot.
</p><p>After the meal, the fishermen advised there was no hope of good catch anymore because at that time of day fish went sleeping. So, they stretched under the trees and slept too, the fishermen and my Dad. When everyone woke up, we slowly started back home.
</p><p>Returning, we didn’t take the shortcut footpath through the forest, choosing to walk over the low hills and dales because the papers permitted to stay away till the evening.
</p><p>From the top of one of the hills, we saw a small lake in the distance, it was perfectly round, rimmed with the growth of reeds.
</p><p>When we reached it, Dad wanted to take a swim at any rate, although the fishermen tried to talk him out of the idea. One of them told it was too often that in that round lake, called Witch’s Eye, someone got drowned caught with its duckweed.
</p><p>But Dad doffed his clothes, all the same, grabbed hold of the stern of a skiff by the shore and, kicking up foamy splashes, moved off to the reeds by the opposite shore. Halfway through, he remembered the watch on his wrist, took it off and hung on a nail in the stern.
 When he came back in the same manner, the duckweed clung all over his shoulders in long thickly spliced garlands.
</p><p>He was ashore already and putting on his clothes when we saw a woman in a long skirt of villager womenfolks, who ran across the slanted field with indistinct yells. She ran up to us but didn’t say anything new and only repeated what we had heard from the fellow-fisherman.
 </p><p>Near Checkpoint, we were caught in a spell of bad weather and the rain thoroughly drenched us before we got home, but no one fell ill after…</p>
