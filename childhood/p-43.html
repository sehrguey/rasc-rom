<h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>On the New Year Eve, Dad worked the night shift so that the garland lights would not fade in the Christmas trees in homes at the Object. And on the first morning of the New Year, Mom left for her work so that water would flow steadily from the kitchen taps…
</p><p>That morning I woke late when Dad was already home from work. He asked who visited the previous night, and I answered that Mom’s new woman-friend from the former Zimins’ rooms came briefly.
</p><p>Then I read, went to the rink, played hockey in felt boots and came back again to the books on the big sofa.
</p><p>I was watching the concert of Maya Kristalinskaya on the TV—as usual, she wore a wide kerchief around her neck to hide the traces of the personal life drama—when Mom came from work. I ran from the parents’ room to the hallway, and Dad was already there from the kitchen.
</p><p>He stood in front of my Mom, who had not yet had time to take her coat off. Then, while they stood strangely still and silent, facing each other, there happened something baffling to Dad’s hand, which, as if the only moving part in their frozen confrontation, broke the stillness with a short awkward slap against each of Mom’s cheeks.
</p><p>Mom said, “Kolya! What’s that?” and she burst into tears which I had never seen.
</p><p>Dad started yelling and demonstrating a saucer with cigarette butts which he found behind the blind on the windowsill in the kitchen.
</p><p>Mom tried to say something about her woman-friend neighbor, but Dad rebuffed in a loud voice that Belomor-Canal cigarettes were not a women’s smoke.
</p><p>He flung his sheepskin overcoat on and, before getting out, yelled, “And you have sworn to never ever even shit within a mile off him!”
</p><p>The door slammed furiously, Mom went to the kitchen and then across the landing to her new woman-friend in the former Zimins’ rooms. I put on my coat and felt boots, and went to the rink again. On my way there, I met my brother and sister coming back home, I did not say anything to them about what happened there.
</p><p>At the rink, I was hanging around until full dark. I had no wish to play, neither wanted to go back home, so I just milled about aimlessly or sat by the stove in the shed.
</p><p>Then Natasha came up to me on the ice empty of anyone already, she said that Mom and my brother were waiting for me on the road and that at home Dad dumped the Christmas tree on the floor and kicked Sasha, and now we were going to sleepover at some acquaintances’.
</p><p>Under the desolate light of lamps above the empty road, the four of us walked to the five-story building, where Mom knocked on the door to an apartment on the first door.
</p><p>There lived the family of some officer with two children, I knew the boy from the school, but not his sister, who was from a too senior grade.
</p><p>Mom shared some sandwiches she brought along, but I did not feel like eating. She went to sleep together with my brother and sister on the folding coach, and I was bedded on the carpet next to the bookcase. Through its glass doors, I saw <em>The Captain Dare-Devil</em> by Louis Bussenard and asked for permission to read it, while the light from the kitchen was reaching the carpet…
</p><p>In the morning, we left and crossed the Courtyard to one of the corner buildings, I knew that it was the hostel for officers though I never had entered it.
</p><p>In the long corridor on the second floor, Mom told us to wait because she needed to talk with the man whose name she  mentioned but I've forgotten it entirely.
</p><p>For some time, the three of us waited silently on the landing, then Mom showed up in the corridor and led us home.
</p><p>She opened the door with her key. From the hallway, through the open door to the parents’ room, the Christmas tree was seen dropped on its side by the balcony door, splinters of smashed decorations scattered the carpet around it.
</p><p>The wardrobe stood with its doors ajar, and in front of it there was a soft mound of Mom’s clothes, each one ripped from top to bottom…
</p><p>Dad was away from home for a whole week, but then Natasha said that he was coming back and so it happened the following day.
 And we started to live on further again…
</p><p>When the holidays ended, I found a newspaper package in my schoolbag, the uneaten sandwich stayed there from the last school day in the previous term. The rotten ham filled the schoolbag with a putrid fetor. Mom washed it from within with soap and the stench got weaker but still stayed…
</p><p>At school, they held the contest between the pioneer grades at collecting waste paper.
</p><p>After classes, the pioneers from our class, in groups of threes or fours, visited the houses of Block and the five-story buildings, knocked on doors, and asked if they had some waste paper. At times, they presented us with huge piles of old newspapers and magazines, but I never went to the corner building with the hostel for officers. Instead, I proposed my group of pioneer collectors to visit the Detachment’s Library, where they gave us a sizable score of books. Some of them were pretty worn and tattered but others quite new as, for instance, <em>The last of Mohicans </em>by Fenimore Cooper with nice engraving pictures which only missed a few pages at the end…
</p><p>One evening, when we were playing Hide-and-seek in the snow burrows along the outer side of the ice rink, some senior boy said that he could lift five people at once, and easily too, with just one hand. It seemed so improbable that I bet with him. He only warned that the five people should lie down in a compact group for him to grip conveniently.
</p><p>So, he and I, as opponents, and a few more boys went towards the Bugorok-Knoll beyond the light of the rink illuminating lamps and found a level spot.
</p><p>I lay down on my back in the snow and, following his instructions, stretched out my arms and legs, for the four boys to lay upon them: one boy on each, all in all, five people.
</p><p>Yet, he never tried to lift us. I felt fingers of a stranger unbuttoning my pants and entering my underwear. Unable to break loose from under the four boys who pinned me to the ground, I only yelled and shouted them to get off and let me go.
</p><p>Then suddenly I felt free because they all ran away. I buttoned my pants up and went home angry with myself that I could so easily be fooled. Scored one more visit to the topmast with a teapot.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…and only quite recently it suddenly dawned on me that it was not a practical joke as with “showing Moscow”. It was the check to verify suspicions aroused by my fancy dress at the New Year party.
</p><p>However ridiculous it seems, it took almost a whole life span until I guessed what’s what.
</p><p>And here lies the third but, probably, the most cardinal of my Achilles’ heels – belated thinking…)
</p></div><p>On the way from school, my friend Yura Nikolayenko broke the news of my Mom being drawn in a caricature pinned to the stand by the House of Officers. In that picture, she was tossing: to go to her husband or her lover?
</p><p>I uttered not a word to answer but for more than a month, I couldn’t go anywhere near the House of Officers. Then, of course, I had to visit it because they showed “The Iron Mask” with Jean Marais in the role of D’Artagnan.
</p><p>Before the show, with all of my inside tightly squeezed by shame and fear, I sneaked to the stand, but the Whatman sheet pinned at it already bore a new caricature of a drunk truck driver in a green padded jacket, and his wife with children shedding blue tears at home.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…it was unlimited relief at that moment, yet, for some reason, until now I can  too vividly recall the caricature of my Mom which I have never seen.
</p><p>She’s got a sharp nose in it, and long red fingernails while tossing – to which of the two?
</p><p>No, Yura Nikolayenko did not describe the picture for me, he only retold the inscription…)
</p></div><p>In early spring, Dad came home very upset after a meeting at his work. There was another wave of the redundancy purge and at that meeting, they said who else to make redundant if not him?
</p><p>So, we started to pack things up for loading them into a big iron railway container, as other redundant people before us. However, the actual loading was done by Dad alone because the four of us left two weeks earlier…
</p><p>On the eve of our departure, I was sitting on a couch in the room of the Mom’s new woman-friend across the landing.
</p><p>The woman and Mom went to the kitchen, and I stayed back with a thick book which I picked up from the piles of waste paper at the Detachment’s Library and later presented to Mom’s woman-friend.
</p><p>Turning pages with the biography of some ante-revolution writer, I idly looked through the seldom inset illustrations with photographic pictures of unknown people in strange clothes from another, alien, world. Then I opened the thick volume somewhere in the middle and inscribed on the page margin, “we are leaving.”
</p><p>That moment, I remembered the principle of creating animated cartoons: if on several subsequent pages you spell some word—a letter per page—and then bend the pages and release them one by one so that they quickly flip one after another, then letters will form up the word you wrote.
</p><p>And I inscribed separate letters in the corners of subsequent pages, “I-S-e-h-r-g-u-e-y-O-g-o-l-t-s-o-f-f-a-m-l-e-a-v-i-n-g.”
</p><p>Yet, the cartoon did not work out as supposed. In fact, it did not work at all, but I did not care. I just slammed the book, left it on the couch, and walked away across the landing to a room with packs of things lined along its walls…
</p><p>Early in the morning, a bus left the Courtyard for the station of Valdai. Besides the four of us, there were a couple of families going on their vacations.
</p><p>When the bus turned to the road of concrete slabs descending from Block, Mom suddenly asked me who we would better live with: my Dad, or the man whose name I absolutely do not remember.
</p><p>“Mom! We do not need anyone! I will work, I’ll be helping you,” said I.
</p><p>She did not answer...
And those were not just words, I believed in what I was saying, however,  Mom knew the labor legislation better than me…
</p><p>When the descent was over, the bus stopped at the turn to the Pumping Station and Checkpoint. The man about who Mom had just asked me, climbed in. He approached her, took her hand, telling something in a low voice.
</p><p>I turned away to look out of the window...
 He went out, the bus slammed the door and drove on. In a couple of minutes it pulled up at the white gate of Checkpoint.
</p><p>The sentries checked us and the vacationers and opened the gate letting the bus out of the Zona.
</p><p>A black-haired soldier grabbed hold of a white-paint-coated rod in the gate’s grate while floating by behind the glass in the bus window.
</p><p>I realized with absolute clarity that never again would I ever see the familiar gate of the Zona, neither that unknown soldier next to it, however, one thing I didn’t know yet... It was my way of leaving childhood.</p><h3  class="headline"> ~ ~ ~ </h3>
