<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> Defying the Wash<br>&nbsp;</h3>

    <p>
I took a sheet of paper from my briefcase with the report to the trade-union committee about spending 3 rubles to visit  a patient in hospital.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...my current public position was visiting SMP-615 employees when they got to  hospital, and comfort them with a delivery and for each such occasion the trade-union committee granted exactly 3 rubles.
</p><p>Though visiting ill colleagues solo, I had later to present reports on spending the amount of 3 rubles signed by no less than three persons because of so huge a sum...)
</p></div><p>I put the paper on the side of a concrete pipe, 1.5 meters in diameter and 1.5 meters long, and they signed it without reading.
"And now?" asked Grinya, "Are you changing or what?"
</p><p>My stance to black Saturdays was always firmly negative but what else had I to do?
I changed into the work clothes, took my shovel and went to clean the upshot truck-dump with the mortar stuck to its insides, replacing Vera Sharapova.
She was sharp and since long noticed that so was my way to drive off my jealousy fits…
</p><p>At night, back to  Decemberists 13, I was lying prostrate in the unfolded bed-armchair amid  the pitch-black darkness in the living room.
</p><p>Laying all the time on your back is tiring. I wanted to change position and turn over, but I did not allow myself to stir because I needed to become inconspicuous, yet movements might betray your location.
</p><p>When motionless, I kinda became a part to the bottom of a boundless ocean, nothing but that  immense ocean remained in the all empty world.
To become a part to such absolute void, you should be smoothly streamlined and make no rips, so that nothing would cling to you and just keep floating by on its way.
But what a vast emptiness it was!
</p><div id="span"><p>(...there is a no direr curse than the old folk curse "be it empty to you!"</p><p>
The purpose of any loss is to make you feel empty, deprived, drained of something...
</p><p>Love comes as a defensive reaction to the endless void in which there rotatess the life's mill-wheel to come back to  its starting point as empty as it left it.
</p><p>Love comes to ward off despair, when you're empty of the slightest idea what to do about the useless fluky gift – your life – when you find no means to kill off the eternity measured out to you. When you feel at loose ends, when you have nothing to live for except the  aimless living on.
</p><p>Love comes to cancel empty search, to present your life with some meaning – to serve! – to give it the point – to serve!
</p><p>Love is selfless, self-denying slavery and zealous service to the object of love – a two-legged mammal, or a collection of stamps, or...doesn't matter...it depends on how lucky you were...
</p><p>And suddenly, kinda bolt from the blue, the shackles fall away, you're said, "Off with you! Enjoy your freedom!"
And you find yourself in the void where there is no purpose, no sense, where you have just to live – like a crystal, like a blade of grass, like a rain-worm.
</p><p>We are not slaves, slaves are not we!
</p><p>No! I want back! To where love was...it would fence from the horror of facing the emptiness, would give meaning to the senseless repetitive fuss.
</p><p>Love will be the one to make decisions. I will obediently execute the orders!.
</p><p>Love is the sand where to bury the frightened ostrich head...
</p><p>Damn you, love!
How empty it feels without you!..)
</p></div><p>Surviving in the vapid void is not a trivial problem.
Of course, there is always a choice. Why survive if you can stop the torment at any moment? However, never in my life had I even played with the thought of suicide, not formatted that way.
Well, and since there was no choice, I had to solve the problem.
</p><p>There is  just one and only solution – systematicy. Nothing else can serve to overcome emptiness.
Whether you're systematically jamming vodka, or systematically jogging in the park does not matter much as long as you keep adhering to a certain cycle…
</p><p>Luckily, I already had some investments that provided certain means for spanning the void.
The five-day workweek, that's for one.
My participation in SMP-615 public life – two.
And also, visits to Nezhin for intellectual communication with Zhomnir, once in two or three months.
Who would ask for more?
</p><p>Any system, so that to work, would need some sort of a carrot to tip for spinning the wheel, to reward for successful  conclusion its vicious circle, to stimulate diving into the next, exactly same, rotation.
</p><p>On Thursdays, I visited the bathhouse with two tours into the steam room.
Bars of soap and sauna whisker, aka a bunch of dried birch twigs for self-whipping midst the burning hot steam, were on sale at the bathhouse ticket office on the first floor.
Leaving the bathhouse, I left those instruments of pleasure on the gray marble tops of low tables  in the common washing hall on the second floor, taking home only the changed underwear for the subsequent laundry.
</p><p>On my way from the bathhouse to the place of residence, I consumed two bottles of Zhigulevskoye beer and bought an issue of <em>Morning Star </em> from the news stall in Peace Square, for reading with a dictionary until next Thursday.
</p><p>On Mondays, I did washing in a tin basin on the bench in the yard, in winter the washing was done in the summer-room section of the shed.
</p><p>The ironing day depended on the weather conditions around the clothesline, which was stretched from the porch to the shed and not to the wicket anymore; better late, than never.
</p><p>Weekends were harder to fill, but once a month in "The Peace" cinema they showed another of action movies starring Belmondo, or a comedy with Jean Richard.
</p><p>Summer Sundays were no problem at all, I spent them on the Seim beach lying on the pink, with red circles, cover for wrapping babies. That very one which on weekdays was spread over the table top when ironing the dry laundry. That cover stayed at  Decemberists 13 after one of your earlier visits there. It was rather short, and my legs, in part, stayed outstretched  over the bare sand, but who cares?
</p><p>Three times a Sunday, I had a swim for the buoys, where there were no screaming bathers. I lay on my back over  the water, with my arms and legs wide apart, and pronounced the self-made ritual formula,
</p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"Oh, water! Ran into each corner of mine! We be of one blood – thou and me.”
</p><div id="span"><p>(...to assemble such a phrase I had to involve Fitzgerald and Kipling in collaboration, but they did not mind my plagiarism...)
</p></div><p>Then I swam back to the screams and splashes, got out the water to the coverlet to lie down and turn from side to side in the scorching hot sun, at times reading <em>Morning Star.</em>
On the beach, I read it without a dictionary, underlining the words which later had to be written out in a copybook.
</p><p>At the midday-meal time, I left the beach and went to the store in the nearby village of Khutor Taransky.
It was a casual <em>khutta </em>under a thatched roof, but with a thick iron strap fixed across the door with a weighty padlock.
</p><p>Store Manager, the elderly burly woman, who  prided herself on having seen even Sakhalin Island, unlocked the door for just one hour.
When she dropped the iron strap on the porch, the door opened into a room with two dust-covered windows in the same wall with the door and wide two-tier shelves running along the remaining three walls,  above the the plank counters.
</p><p>I systematically bought one item of canned food, a pack of cookies and a bottle of lemonade.
After opening the victuals with the opener borrowed from Store Manager, I took the meal out to the empty street of four silent <em>khuttas</em> and deep sand in the road, sizzling from the heat.
There, next to an old crooked elm, I sat on the wide bench of a cracked but mighty board turned gray by the years of exposure to the whims of weather going its unchanging season circles around the tree over the bench by the thatched <em>khutta</em> of the store.
</p><p>The assortment of things on the store shelves never changed. Buying a can of "Tourist's Breakfast", I saw that next Sunday I would have "Sprats in Tomato Sauce" for the meal, and a week later "Zucchini Squash".
The can with the sticker "Adjika" instilled obscure apprehension because I kinda heard somewhere that it was bitterer than even wasabi, yet it was still a month away. Maybe, I'd combine it with the small jar of cherry jam from the following shelf? To make a complex dinner.
</p><p>In the end, I wiped the aluminum spoon with the wrapper from the finished off cookies, and hid the spoon at the back of the <em>khutta</em>, in the thatched straw over the blind wall, the way Anti-Soviet<em> kulak </em>bandits were hiding their barrel-sawed shotguns...
Even Marcello Mastroianni  hardly could have dreams of so sweet "Dolce Vita"...
</p><p>And right in that<em> khutta</em>, I bought a doll for your birthday present.
There were only two dolls on the shelves – a girl and a monkey, both of rubber. Each one had a tiny squeaker in its back to make a sound when squeezed.
The pair of motorcyclists, who somehow managed to overcome the  deep scorching sand in the road on that day, advised me to but the monkey, but I preferred the girl, as I had been planning all previous Sundays, in a bright dress—also of rubber—to her knees.
</p><p>I could buy a present from Department Store in the city, of course, but all the toys there were made of plastic.
Besides, I wanted it to be a gift from that enchanted <em>khutta</em> with its cool shade, kinda sanctuary amid the summer heat…</p>
