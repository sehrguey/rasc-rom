<p>In the middle of summer, in the middle of a week, and even in the middle of a working day, Uncle Tolik came suddenly home. “Fetch the fishing rods, quick!” yelled he, racing into the <em>khatta.</em>
</p><p>Hastily cinching the tackle to the “Jawa” rack, he announced that there happened a breakage in the dam of the Kandeebynno fishery lakes and all the fish fled to the Yezooch river.
</p><p>We rode across the city, shot over the bridge to Zagrebelya and only then Uncle Tolik slowed down, driving along the Yezooch  in search of a vacant spot. And that was not an easy task.
 Along both riverbanks, the mixed crowd of boys, and youths, and grownup men were standing in almost uninterrupted line waving their fishing rods or poles towards and from the invigorated stream, jerking out empty hooks or flashing quiver of the catch.
</p><p>It was a spontaneous all-out day off. It was the powerful, compelling, demonstration of angling forces of the Konotop city.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…up till now, I am not quite certain if the breakout from the fishery lakes was in some weird way connected to the Mad Summer ‘68 in France or, after all, the revolutionary situation there was triggered off by the Kandeebynno events…
</p><p>And lastly but also possibly, what if both developments had some third-party cause, not yet discovered but undeniably common…)
</p></div><p>A few days later, Skully and I visited the Kandeebynno on foot.
 The fish lakes stretched like a vast field covered with the dingy crust of drying-up mud. Seldom spots of dark green algae were still peeping here and there. In one of such spots, there occured a shallow, yet lengthy pit full of live fish.
 We were picking them out with bare hands; not very large fish though, about twenty centimeters or so. Skully did not miss bringing a mesh-bag with him, but I had to take off my tank top and tie its tail into a knot to make a sack for the catch.
</p><p>At home, they fried the fish which was enough for both families and even Zhoolka had his share. Aunt Lyuda teased Uncle Tolik that he had never brought such a catch from his fishing tours…
</p><p>Summer’s the rightest time for repair and reconstruction works.
Father cut a hole in the dead wall of the kerogas section on the veranda and inserted a small frame with a glazed leaf on hinges. The daylight came to the section and made it more comfortable canceling the need to switch the bulb on each time when dropping in to have some water.
</p><p>Then came the kitchen’s turn. One Sunday, everything was taken out of it into the yard, except for the too heavy refrigerator by the door. On the same day, Mother and Aunt Lyuda whitewashed all the walls, ceiling and the brick stove.
 They worked until finished and it was too late for bringing things in, they just washed the floor in the kitchen and everyone had to spent the night in our room.
</p><p>Natasha gave up her folding bed to Irocnka and Valerik, returning to her old place across the end of the folding couch-bed shared by us, her brothers.
 The spring mattress from the bed of the Arkhipenkos parents was put in the center of the room and there practically remained no place – you had to watch where to squeeze your step.
</p><p>Sasha and I had also to go to bed, not bending the legs up to make room for our sister as yet because Aunt Lyuda decided to take a dip in the kitchen while everyone else was watching TV.
</p><p>From the things left out in the yard, she brought the mirror in the old wooden frame and hung it in its permanent place on the wall above the fridge. Then she poured hot water into a big tin basin for washing and pulled together the striped curtains hanging in the doorway between the kitchen and the room.
</p><p>The light in the room was switched off so as to better see the TV screen, and the volume decreased but I still grumbled that I could not sleep with the sound on. The response, as always, was both disinterested and practical, “You don’t have to be listening. Pull the blanket over your head and sleep.”
</p><p>Aunt Lyuda was splashing in the kitchen, then she called Uncle Tolik to rub her back. When he returned and sat, as before, upon the folding-bed filled with his children, I noticed a narrow gap left between the curtains with a glimpse of the mirror above the refrigerator containing a distanced reflection of the floorboards, half of the tin basin, and the back of Aunt Lyuda in it.
</p><p>And then I did what I had been told to, and pulled the blanket over my head, yet the good advice was followed no further. Instead of sleeping, I placed the blanket on the wooden armrest of the folding couch-bed and wrinkled it up into a standing ripple so as to watch from under it the view in the faraway mirror on the opposite wall of the kitchen.
</p><p>Actually, there was not much to watch – wet floorboards with splotches of suds and a slightly moving shoulder blade with the wet lock of black hair stuck to it. Then there remained only the floor and the empty half-basin left by Aunt Lyuda.
</p><p>Yet, she soon appeared again in the mirror frame—much closer and clearer—because she came up to it with a towel around her waist under the naked tits.
 She smiled a little cunning smile, licked her lips and looked straight into my eyes all the way through my blanket periscope.
</p><p>I shut the eyes firmly and didn’t open them anymore, while she was wiping the floor in the kitchen and coming over to the room…
</p><p>Then everyone got to their beds, the light and TV were turned off. Only that moment I, at last, removed the hot blanket from over my head. The room was pitch dark.
Soon after, various snuffling from all the sides mixed with the darkness, and then from the spot where the Arkhipenkos’ spring mattress was placed on the floor, there came some cautiously low sound as if a bale of straw was getting squeezed then loosened in slow rhythmic repetition.
</p><p>I did not turn my head. Firstly, what the use amid such darkness? And then, after the tons of books read by me, I could tell even not seeing that they were making love down there…
</p><p>Six months later, on a dark winter evening when I and Skully went to take a shower in the Plant, he called me to watch through the windows of the female section in Plant Bath  shedding a warm yellow light on the snowdrifts in bluish darkness.
 I did not approach it.
Was I shy to do it in his presence? I don’t know. But even when going alone for a shower, I never watched through those windows…
</p><p>And that same summer Raissa asked us to tour, for the old good times' sake,  the city kindergartens with a puppet show.
</p><p>In less than a week we gave ten performances.
In the morning, we came to a kindergarten indicated by her the day before, installed in their dining room the screen brought by a Plant truck, hung the backdrop, set up tripods with the hut and a forest tree, performed the show before the much-respected toddler public, and moved to the next kindergarten – the scenery on the same truck, and the actors by streetcar.
</p><p>Kuba grumbled that we were slaving at the conveyor belt for just a “thank you” because no one knew how much Raissa ripped off the directors in eye-to-eye talk in their offices at kindergartens, but I did not care.
 First, every day Raissa treated us with ice-cream of the most expensive Plombir flavor, and one time she took everyone to a movie show in the Vorontsov Movie Theater, and it was not her fault that “The Western Corridor” turned out such an eerie splatter film.
</p><p>Besides, and most importantly, the money we had earned that week wouldn’t amount to the price of watching films in Club with the check-passes from Director, that we enjoyed for years after her lead…
</p><p>The Club alone was not enough to satisfy my natural proclivities. Even though attending the temple of Melpomene disguised as Children Sector where worshipers were blest with free film shows (which, undeniably, was a nice pastime), I felt an additional pull to architecture and the only available grounds for practicing it was our<em> khutta’s </em>yard.
</p><p>The parents allowed erecting an experimental structure there propped by the fence of the Turkovs from Number 17, if and only if it would in no way block access to the shed sections in the yard, to eschew complaints from other dwellers of the<em> khutta.</em>
</p><p>Together with my brother and Skully, I went after construction materials to the Grove and from among the quagmire bogs of the Swamp, we cut a couple of bundles of two-meter-long whips, added to the booty a generous bunch of green twigs, cinched everything onto two bikes and transported home.
</p><p>A number of the procured whips became the lattice roof secured by pieces of wire and all sorts of strings.  While the roof's one edge rested on the fence, the other one was supported by the lattice wall produced of the same whips in the like manner. Our skills at tying knots and diligent stickability to the task in hand resulted in a crisscross-styled contraption, kinda sturdy cage where you could pace to and fro for three steps almost without stooping, was  accomplished and covered with the finishing layer of leafy twigs over the roof and two walls because the fence served the third one and the concluding, fourth, wall provided, by its absence, a conveniently wide entrance. Wow!
</p><p>Inside, the structure smelt pleasantly of withering leaves and, from outside, it caressed your sight by its presence in the yard corner.
</p><p>A week later, the foliage wilted but the delight and ecstasy with the creative efforts drooped even earlier because there arose the unavoidable pesky question which makes each and every creator scratch the back of their head: What now?
</p><p>You would not organize a clandestine pioneer group like that in <em>The Timur’s Team</em> just because there was a suitable structure for the headquarters of such an organization in your yard, would you? Especially if you were past the age for pioneer games…
</p><p>So, Skully and I switched over to our usual pastime – vain hurling of a kitchen knife into the trunk of the old maple tree by the stack of bricks crumbling with age because that year the first Soviet Western “The Uncatchable Avengers” reached, at long last, the Konotop cinemas and the Gypsy’s knife swished across the silver screen to deeply stuck in the white slender trunk of a young birch tree.
</p><p>In real life though, the home-made knife just bounced from the hard bark even when hitting it with the tip of its blade, and that’s the meaning of being born into a wrong era after all the romantic revolutions and splendid wars dried up and left you no chance of riding a horse in the pursuit of fleeing enemies or shooting a fiery machine-gun to beat off their assault…
</p><p>The leaves of the structure dried, blackened and fell off but the cage-like skeleton withstood another couple of years…</p>
