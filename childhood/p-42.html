<p>The  instrument for carving was picked up, as needed, from the tiny blue-paper pack of razors kept by Dad in the bathroom. The blue top bore the brand-name “Neva” and the neat drawing of a black sailboat above it. Each razor in the pack was wrapped in a separate blue envelope embellished with the same sailboat and inscription…
</p><p>With the start of winter, the skin on my hands began to peel off. At first, there formed some small spots of dry skin and, when rubbed and pulled at, it would go off in patches.
</p><p>I didn’t tell anyone about it and in a week took off all of the skin there, like a pair of tattered gloves, up to the wrists. Only the palms’ skin remained in place. And beneath the peeled off patches, there was new skin already…
</p><div id="span"><p>(…I have no idea if there is some scientific explanation for such a case, yet, in my humble opinion, the phenomenon was caused by the book which I met on the shelves of the Detachment’s Library titled <em>The Man Is Changing His Skin.</em>
</p><p>I never borrowed nor skimmed it but the title was remembered and, being an impressionable child, I checked the possibility of the announced change…)
</p></div><p>Both naivety and impressionability were my innate Achilles’ heels...
 Impressed by a record on a 33 RPM disc, I felt a naive desire to write down the lyrics of the song, although it was in a foreign language.
</p><p>My attempt at copying never went further than the first line of which result I also had very grave doubts. Played once, the line distinctly sounded as “azza latsmaderi”, yet at the following audition it somehow changed into “esso dazmaderi” and no matter how long I listened to the record those variants elusively substituted each other impeding a clear-cut decision. But it’s not possible for a recorded disc to swap the words on the fly! Anyway, the project was derailed.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…many years later I heard the song again and readialy recognized  when Louis Armstrong sang up from a laser disk:<br> <strong><em>“ Yes, sir, that’s my lady</em></strong>…)
</p></div><p>The skating rink across the road was from the very start  meant for  playing hockey. Over time, it got bounded with a compact fence of planks, and two hockey goals popped up at the field’s opposite ends.
</p><p>After snowfalls, the boys cleared the field with a pair of wide metal sheets resembling the bulldozer blade. Each shield had a long horizontal handle above it and no less than two or three boys were needed to push the contraption.
</p><p>The snow was moved to the fence opposite the locker-room shed and shoved out of the field with large snow shovels of plywood. That’s why behind that fence there accumulated a tall snow ridge all along the ice rink.
 Those artificial hills of snow were burrowed by boys to become an ever-growing system of tunnels with ramifications, dead ends and stuff as if following the blueprint drawings of my secret shelter.
</p><p>In the evenings, we played Hide-and-seek in those tunnels drowning in the ink-black darkness because the lamp posts  were only put along the fence on the locker room  side of the ice rink. But when you switched a flashlight inside a burrow there popped up white glacial walls holding numberless sparks in their murky depth…
</p><p>The year was ending. In the tear-off calendar on the kitchen wall by the window, there remained but a few tiny-sized pages.<br>
Such tear-off calendars contained as many pages as there were days in their  year and initially the thick mass of hundreds of pages fixed within the glistening tin-strip of the calender’s back gave it a look of solid importance.
</p><p>Each page bore its unique date in bold, as well as the exact time of both sunrise and sunset on that particular day followed by symbols and numbers stating the current phase of the moon, and all that although small printed yet telling information was meant to be torn off and thrown away to keep apace with the time flow.
</p><p>The data on the movements of celestial bodies were placed at the bottom of tiny pages yielding the center to the portrait of one or another Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who was born on that day, and if the day lacked a Member’s birthday, there was a portrait of this or that hero of the Civil War or of the Great Patriotic War. On the reverse side, you could read their biography, but briefly because of the petit page size.
</p><p>Once in a month-and-a-half period, you could come across a crossword in the calendar, besides, there were four dates printed in red because they were holidays: the New Year, May Day, the Great October Revolution Day, and the Constitution Day.
</p><p>However, later Mom started to buy tear-off calendars for women, where instead of Members’ portraits there were pictures of birch-trees upfront and the sewing patterns on the page back, or recipes for pies, and other useful tips.
</p><p>From one of those tips, I learned how to wean your husband from his propensity for spirits:
<br>“Pour a quantity of pulverized burnt cork into a glass of wine and treat your husband to it before the guests’ arrival. When all got together, the burnt cork will show its effect, the carouser will not be able to withstand the pressure of gases in his stomach and start to fart and feel ashamed before the guests which embarrassment will make him abandon the disgraceful habit.”
</p><p>I shared the method with Mom because at times she scolded Dad for his propensity. However, Mom was reluctant to use the advice.
</p><div id="span"><p>(..I couldn’t understand her then – why to complain if you don’t want to eliminate the cause of discomfort?
</p><p>Coming of age I understood my Mom, but now I cannot understand those who could print such idiocy.
</p><p>See? My comprehension works like that crane from a fable wallowing in a marsh swamp who pulls his neck out free, but a wing gets bogged down, the wing is out—oops!—a leg got stuck.
</p><p>Or is it about my comprehension only?..)
</p></div><p>A week before the winter holidays Class Mistress announced that at the New Year Eve school party there would be held the contest for the best fancy dress so we should do our best to win it.
</p><p>I was thrilled by the task at hand and right away conceived the idea of an irresistible carnival dress – no bears or robots anymore, I’d dress up like a gypsy girl!
 Mom laughed when I shared my plan, yet promised to help because she had connections at the Dancing Amateur Activities…
</p><p>At my cautious inquiries in the class – what disguise did they plan for the contest? – the boys invariably answered that no one cared about making any fancy dress and they would attend the party in their casual wear.
</p><p>The dismal prospect distressed me not a little because at a New Year party everything should be as in the movie “The Carnival Night” with streamers flying crisscross through the snowfall of confetti...
 I sought consolation in a soothing thought that it was silly panicking just like before “The Three Musketeers” which show did take place, after all.
 Well, and if the boys had no intention of wearing fancy dresses, then there remained other guys especially from the senior classes who you could rely on…
</p><p>Mom made me a mask like that of Mr. X in the movie “Mr. X”, also of black velvet only she added black gauze strip hung down over the lips. Now, no one would recognize me because from the Dancing Amateur Activities Mom brought a real wig with a long black braid reaching to the waist, a red skirt, a fine blouse and a black shawl with big red flowers.
</p><p>After I changed into all those things, Mom and her new woman-friend who moved into the Zimins’ rooms laughed themselves to tears. Then they said, what if someone invited me to dance? I had to have some practice beforehand.
</p><p>On their advice, I picked up a chair and slowly span keeping it hugged under a waltz record. They laughed even more and said I needed female shoes, my boots did not suit the red skirt.
</p><p>The shoes were also found but they had high heels because you couldn’t wear sandals in winter. Walking on high heels was more than uncomfortable but Mom said, “Practice your patience, Cossack, and get trained while the time allows”.
</p><p>One hour before the New Year party, my carnival costume was packed in a large bag, and off I went to school through the dark night forest.
</p><p>At school, I sneaked up to the second floor, where even the light was not turned on, and in one of the dark classrooms, I changed into my fancy dress. Descending to the first floor, I held onto the railing because walking in high-heel shoes was no better than having skates on your feet.
</p><p>Both the vestibule and the first-floor corridors were lighted rather scantily, yet there was enough illumination to see that everyone, including the guys from senior classes, wore, albeit not the school uniform, yet nothing like carnival costumes.
</p><p>They all stood in small groups or ran back and forth and fell silent when I clap-clapped the shoe heels past them over the parquet flooring, then over the tiles of the vestibule and the following parquet in the next corridor. And where was the celebration then? Where were the streamers and confetti?.
</p><p>A couple of senior boys talked in a whisper to each other  and approached me, “Could you tell the future, gypsy girl?”
</p><p>At that moment School Pioneer Leader appeared and took me with her to the gym.
 The hall was crowded with rows of seats up to the New Year Tree and farther back on both sides of it to accommodate the audience for the performance of a prepared play. So, all my waltzing that chair at home was just useless, the school New Year party program foresaw no dancing whatsoever.
</p><p>School Pioneer Leader seated me in the first row facing the still closed blue curtains. Then she left briefly and brought a masked girl in a Harlequin suit—another stupid fool like me. The girl was placed in the chair next to me, and we were the only mummers in the gym.
</p><p>The curtain fell open and the ninth-graders presented their production of Cinderella. They had good costumes though, I especially liked the tartan cap of the Jester…
 The performance ended, everyone started to clap and I realized that now even the Jester would change into a jacket and his pants.
</p><p>I left the gym and went upstairs to the dark classroom, where I had left my clothes, and changed back. What a bliss it was to get rid of the hatefully painful high-heel shoes and get into my long-longed-for felt boots!
</p><p>Exiting the school, I met my Mom and Natasha who came to admire my masquerade triumph. I briefly explained that there was no carnival, and we went home through the same night forest.
</p><div id="span"><p>(…the trick for being happy all the time is pretty simple: avoid looking back and let the memory do its job quickly – it will forget and erase your blunders, sorrows, and pains.
</p><p>Just keep looking forward to pleasures, successes, and holidays…)
</p></div><p>Though the New Year celebration party fell so flat, ahead still was the long winter holidays with seventeen TV sequels of “Captain Tankesh” where he’d ride his swift horse, and jingle his saber, and make fools of the Austrian occupants of his Hungarian Motherland.
</p><p>In the parents’ room, as always, the Christmas Tree was touching the ceiling with the ruby star on its top, and among the shiny decorations there also hung chocolate candies “Batons” and “Bear Cub in the Forest”.
</p><p>After the lead balloon carnival, life smiled again… </p>
