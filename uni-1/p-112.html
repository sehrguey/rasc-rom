<p>One week later, on my day shift, two soldiers of a Central Asian appearance modestly entered the stoker-house filled with the duet wailing of the furnace and the pump. Probably, from Separate Company, or else ours from the Crimean draft.
</p><p>"We a-need sieve it," one of them said timidly.
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"Da ganja. You knows yoursel."
</p><p>I did not really understand what all that was about, yet it's not proper to look ignorant before the <em>youngs.</em>
"Okay."
</p><p>They came out and returned four already, carrying a couple of some gunnysack bags. I led them to the workshop room and returned to watch the howlers.
</p><p>A couple of times, I checked into the workshop with the grass bunches spread out on the workbench. They greeted me with their mute united smiles of gratitude and I went back – why to interfere with busy people knowing their job?
In two hours, when it was already quiet in the stoker-house, they went away. "We there a-left," said the last in their file with a joyful smile.
</p><p>In a shallow plywood box that had long been kicking back around on the workbench, there was a handful of brownish sticky dust.
I put it away into the iron box next to the never used hammer-and-chisel and just forgot about it...
</p><p>Of course, I remembered the dust in the box when on the payday instead of the usual "Prima" I bought a pack of "Belomor-Canal".
Repeating the procedure demonstrated by Gray, I stuffed a blunt and sparked.
</p><p>Vo-ohoo! What the tha-a-at?
</p><p>And I swam up to the mirror peeping from the wall and looked into to make sure there really was no one behind because there was a clear feeling as if my head was like a balloon that was not filled too tight so you could jab it from opposite sides but not as deep as to burst up but just to spin your fingers inside where they do not reach each other as I was now feeling jabbed through my temples and they twirled inside the brain convolutions but in the mirror there was just only me alone without anyone behind the balloon of me moving with  gentle slowness because I was kinda zeppelin but then yes it was only very necessary to fly over and check the manometer glass or else we all will fly away and very high... you are the moose yourself, Gray...
</p><div id="span"><p>(...that was how I became a <em>nashavan</em>, aka doper, one of the enlightened initiates who get kef from cannabis, aka marijuana, aka grass, aka anasha, aka ganja, aka kif...etc...)
</p></div><p>The first one to figure out my transition to the new quality was Gueerok, a descendant of German colonists, the warrant officer at Fourth Company.
He saw me engulfed in a stoned reading from the scraps of <em> The Red Star </em>daily glued, a decade before, on the tin stand in the grass bordering the drill grounds.
</p><p>The sun was pouring its scorching heat on my piss-cutter. So what? Like to the political studies, like, I'm preparing...Hmm...Americans once again defeated in Vietnam, from our correspondent in Saigon…
He approached me from the right but seeing that the "Belomor-Canal" cigarette in my fingers was smoked up to its paper mouthpiece and there was no hope even for the “heel”-stub, he smiled a weary smile, licked his dry lips, and weakly melted away in the heat…
</p><p>The veil of ignorance slipped off from my enlightened eyes and there came the revelation that everyone in The Orion was on the drag, though each one in his own way...
Karpesha and Pickle in a businesslike manner.
Jafarov – very softly.
Roodko was following the homeopathic shebang of moderate buoys at regular intervals.
Robert – when they treated him, yet not always...
It looked like I almost got late for a departing train.
</p><p>But the coolest weed was by Sasha Lopatko, the Club painter.
In his room, I was getting in the state of weightlessness as if on a visit to the orbital space station Salyut; only not often, because of his meanness.
Roodko also agreed that he had never seen such a greedy egoist in his life. And strange it seemed indeed when taking into account such a good father – a minister of the cult, who should have had infused his son with the love towards your neighbor...
</p><div id="span"><p>(...when on high, your drift can be sort of different to another time of being under.
In kef, generally, you’re getting filled with all-forgiving calm, you feel mellow and nappy, and you want any other mother’s son feel good too and you get so discreet and unobtrusive, you don't want to disturb anyone's fluff.
</p><p>Or you could suddenly notice some funny side in the surrounding reality and – you're done, you just cannot stop, you'll laugh until completely exhausted, then you'll catch your breath and start laughing again.
That kind of drift is called "to catch the arrival". That’s the most dangerous drift if you’re a TV announcer.
</p><p>Still another time, you could get concentrated on doing something and went on doing it, and doing it, and doing in the mode of utter circumspection and methodicality with the utmost, ofttimes unnecessary, finesse and over-perseverance, and though it’s so fucking long ago   that you should’ve drop it,  you'll still keep   doing it and doing... Like that team of zeks who felled an oak coppice equipped  with a couple of jigsaws.
</p><p>Or, let’s take, the so-called "piggy" drift; this is when you got started eating something and all of a sudden there unfolds such a gamma of taste sensations that you, without ever noticing it, could put away a whole pot of cold macaroni and scrape the bottom.
</p><p>And, on the whole, you became ever so prudent, awesomely circumspect and when some buddy’s coming up to you, like, "Hi, how's your nothing?" you knew already at which point of his nonprofit socializing he’d beg of you a pinch for joint.
</p><p>Or there may get started to form all kinds of deep thoughts by you – fucking Isaac Newton! – only that they did not linger to allow for shaping them clearly but get lost because of one thing or another distracted you over to something else equally profound. All in all, a play of shadows on the swirling whiffs of fog.
</p><p>Listening to music when you ride the wave is the utmost drift...)
</p></div><p>In the musicians’ we had a record player on the bookshelf together with the one and only LP disc, "Burn" by The Deep Purple...
Getting seated on the floor next to a speaker, I would hold the disc cover in my hands and consider it unswervingly till all of the side played to the end – there were their busts, like, in bronze, with a tongue of flame from each one's head, like, a lighter, sort of, the dudes were clearly understanding what's what in blasting…
</p><p>A real bummer popped up when anasha suddenly ran out and, no matter whomever you rolled up, no one had it; such a period was called "the empty suction".
 Everyone became dog snappy, some buddies even got crashed  because of the fucking <em>khoomar</em> was so too pressing. No kidding, they became just fragments a-jitter; some simply eyesore sight…
</p><p>Once Gray heated me with pills that he brought from the city.
</p><p>"Would ye?"
</p><p>"What's that?"
</p><p><em>"Nyshtyak."</em>
</p><p>"Okay".
</p><p>He was passing them, one by one, for me to swallow. With half of the pack over, I said, "And what's the dose?"
</p><p>"All's <em>nyshtyak."</em>
</p><p>So I consumed the whole pack.
Then a roar flooded the ears, as from a waterfall, and the night got dense and dark around.
</p><p>Oh, the stoker-house. Vanya's shift...
I entered.
</p><p>He talked to me but I couldn't get it at all. Then I began to walk around the furnace, what for?.
 He told me later that at one point I stopped in the dark passage behind the boiler, and stood there for half-hour as a monument, like, in bronze.
And, most importantly, I was afraid of going to bed: what if getting somehow asleep I wouldn't wake up? But eventually, I came to myself.
</p><p>And Gray was just a bitchy scumbag not knowing the dose himself, kinda experimenting on people whether I'd survive or not.
</p><p>"But you're some fucking moose!." </p>
