 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Youth<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>Next week, coming back to the Plant after the midday break I, as always, dropped into Vladya's <em>khutta </em>
    to flock and go on together.
</p><p>Vladya shared the news about one of his neighbor's hens who died in the yard that morning and concluded with the suggestion of taking the body over with us to hang it in our locker room; just for fun.
</p><p>The plan did not inspire me too much but I still lent Vladya a helping hand in smuggling the demised into the Plant because  you needed  both your hands to climb  the wall along Professions Street but if dragging along a newspaper package with a dead hen, you had nothing to grab hold of those holes in the concrete slabs with...
</p><p>From the locker room ceiling there hung a length of wire for a light bulb, which was missing together with its socket.
</p><p>Vladya took someone's unfinished <em>shabashka</em> from under the window, rested it on a locker in the middle row, climbed upon the work in progress and wrapped the unemployed wire around the hen's neck.
 She froze up there with her dirty white wings  spread loosely above the naked skinny legs.
</p><p>The midday break was over and the Mechanical Shop Floor machine-tools started their scraping wails when a plump black-haired  locksmith from the Repair Unit entered the room. Catching a glimpse of the bird, he did not laugh but left immediately. In a split-second, our Overseer, Borya Sakoon, flew in.
</p><p>With his eyebrows shot up and the lips  pouched to farm the small letter "o", motionlessly stood he for one entire moment staring at the listless animal above his uplifted face. Then he turned over to us, "Hairy-yobbos! You did it, bitches!"
</p><p>For some unadvertised reason, Borya was in the habit of calling The Orpheuses working at the Experimental Unit "the hairy-yobbos"...
</p><p>We, certainly, denied the allegation but Vladya took the dead bird off, wrapped it back into the same newspaper and dropped somewhere outside the Repair Shop Floor.
 In the final analysis, Borya was right – with merely two eyewitnesses, by the end of that working day the entire Repair Shop Floor knew that the hairy-yobbos (the workingmen masses slavishly aped the Overseer’s example in calling us that name) fixed a chick in the locker room. And if the thing remained there for at least half-hour it would inevitably give the kickoff of grim rumors circulating Konotop about someone got hanged at the KaPeVeRrZe Plant...
</p><p>Olga and I ceased dating at the gate of her aunt's <em>khutta</em> because we found a more suitable place, or rather she showed it to me.
</p><p>A little farther along Budyonny Street, there was a short dead-end to the left, leading up to the closed iron gate of the oil storage base. Near that gate, alongside a garden fence, there stood a park bench.
 Who and when dragged it so far from the Park I couldn't say but, strategically, it was positioned in an impeccably  correct spot wrapped in the shadow out of reach of the feeble light from the lamp above the nearby gate.
 On that bench, I got acquainted in absentia with Olga's Konotop relatives...
</p><p>Her mother's sister, Nina, immediately after the war served as a telephone net switcher at the headquarters of a Soviet Army division stationed in Poland.
 On her demobilization, Nina didn't return to the Soviet Union because she had married a Pole and they had  a child already, so Nina stayed to live in her husband’s land.
</p><p>Four years later, she arrived in Konotop to attend the funeral of one of her parents and that was a mistake. They never let her go back despite the fact that her young daughter remained in Poland, and the country itself was a member of the Socialist Camp Community. She never found out what happened to her daughter or her husband nor did she know anything about their present situation, because none of her letters was answered.
</p><p>Fifteen years later, Aunt Nina registered her marriage with Uncle Kolya who did not drink and had a good job in the forestry, only he often needed to go somewhere by his motorcycle with a sidecar. Yet, he had built a really good <em>khutta </em>of three rooms and a kitchen. They had no children and adopted a baby girl, named her Olya and were very fond of her. Not long ago they bought a piano for Olya although it's, probably, too late to start playing it at eleven.
</p><p>Aunt Nina worked at the Meat-Packing Plant in three shifts. To reach her workplace she had to walk two kilometers along the railway track on the city outskirts.
Yet, on the other hand, her family didn't need  buying meat at Bazaar because even though the bags of workers after their shifts were looked through at the Meat-Packing Plant check-entrance, they never frisked the panties of exiting women.
</p><p>And on that same bench, we talked about Art.
 For example, there we discussed the "Romeo and Juliet" after  watching the flicks together  in the basement cinema at Loony.
</p><p>"They talked and talked and I could not make a damn thing out  what all their talks were about, yet tears were dripping from my eyes all the same as if by some fool...”
</p><div id="span"><p>(...which was a very well-defined assessment, by the by, because the rhymed and metered speech makes words you know seem unknown obscuring even so simple a fact that more than one of noble ladies in Verona, way younger than you, had babies at your age...)
</p></div><p>It was also there  (I'm still about the bench) that Olga harpooned me up, hard and securely. She uttered just one phrase but if you're a born patsy of graphomanic you're in a deep trap.
</p><p>"Yesterday I entered in my diary: ‘...when he kissed me goodbye I was devastatingly happy.’”
</p><p>Dammit! You're done for! And there is no way out!
Firstly, in many tons of the read and re-read literary output, I had never come across such an expression " devastatingly happy". Secondly, she kept a diary! Thirdly, but not lastly, I was there in that journal!.
</p><p>After the dances, we sometimes saw her girlfriend Sveta to the porch of Sveta's <em>khutta.</em>
At so late a time the Konotopers who dwelt in <em>khuttas</em> did not venture into their yards, more so Sveta's Granny and Grandpa.
After giggling by our side for the stretch of a smoke, Sveta went in to bed, and the porch with the narrow plank bench was left at our disposal.
</p><p>On one of such evenings, Olga told me to wait on that porch while she'd be gone to her <em>khutta</em> because Aunt Nina had the third shift that day and Uncle Kolya gone by his motorcycle somewhere in the district.
</p><p>It took a long wait before from the the neighboring yard came the tinkle of the handle-latch in the wicket closed by departing Aunt Nina. A few minutes later, Olga appeared at the porch and mutely beckoned me to follow. We went out into the back-alley and noiselessly entered the yard of her <em>khutta</em>.
</p><p>The door from the veranda opened to a large kitchen succeeded by an even larger living-room to the right, and a bedroom to the left, both separated from the kitchen with cloth curtains in the doorways. After the living-room, there was another bedroom for Olga and small Olya. We did not go there but turned into the owners' bedroom to the left.
</p><p>Olga switched on the feeble night-light lamp and went out to the bedroom behind the living room. I was left alone facing the large double bed of a ceremonial aspect with the  dim glint over its nickel-plated siderails, and a smaller, more casual, bed next to the curtains in the doorway to the kitchen. Tight grip of unrelenting tension overwhelmed me.
</p><p>She returned in a dressing gown whose unbuttoned sides were kept in place by her arms folded on its front. Not uttering a word, we both looked at the smaller bed and Olga put out the light.
 Under the gown, she had only panties on. I hastened to follow the suit reserving just my underpants. Then, in the bed, there followed a long wordless wrestling match for each of her dressing gown sleeves. Finally, I threw the whole item on a chair by the wall, the score of the clothes we had on became even – 1:1.
</p><p>When I turned over to her, she lay on her back under the cover pulled up to her chest  shielded with her   tightly crossed arms. I felt it was chilly in the room and got under the cover too.
 The scramble about her small panties took no less efforts than that with the large dressing gown. At last, there we were both stark naked, next to the cover shoved aside because it got darn hot under it. And then…
</p><p>Then she writhed and dodged furiously from under me, pushing my hands away. I managed only to rub my dick between her thighs and against the tiny turf of hair without knowing what was what but feeling just a little more and...Now, almost...about there...Damn, she turned off again!.
</p><div id="span"><p>(...I would do the deed, I swear I would, if not for the lack of time...
That night the cuckoo in the kitchen clock went crazy and jumped out with her shrill "coo! coo!" every other couple of minutes and now it was already croaking six and soon Olya would be getting up for her school so I had to put things on, quick, and go away before Aunt Nina were back from her work...)
</p></div><p>Of course, that night we allowed ourselves too much  and got way too far for any fail-safe. Hugs and kisses by the <em>khutta</em> wicket or on Sveta's porch were not enough anymore, and wouldn't do.
</p><p>But where? And when?
 On November 7, said Olga, after young Olya would have passed in the holiday demonstration column of her school and be taken by Uncle Kolya and Aunt Nina on a visit to his village.
</p><p>And that time no tricks would help Olga to wriggle away, the cuckoo's cries would mean nothing with the whole night being our own…</p>
