 <h3 style="margin-top: 3em;"><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Adolescence<br>&nbsp;</h3>

 <p>At 19 Nezhin Street, the old man Duzenko was no more and that part of the <em>khutta </em>was dwelt already by two old women: Duzenko’s widow and her sister who moved in from her village.
 </p><p>And in the half-<em>khutta </em> belonging to Ignat Pilluta there remained only his widow, Pillutikha. She never stuck her nose outside her  den,   keeping the window shutters in Nezhin Street  closed for weeks on end. Sure enough, she had to visit Bazaar or the Nezhin Store but my footpath never crossed hers…
 </p><p>In February Grandma Katya was suddenly taken to the hospital.
  Probably, it’s only for me, with my life divided between school, Club, books, and the TV it happened suddenly. Trying to get everywhere leaves no time to see things right about you.
</p><p>Coming from school, I clinked the wicket latch-hook and ran up our two-step porch past Pillutikha’s window catching a glimpse of her standing in profile cloaked with a loosely hung black kerchief, her hand raised menacingly against the wall between her and our kitchens.
</p><p>At home, I dropped the folder with school notebooks into the crevice between the folding couch-bed and the cabinet under the TV and went back to the kitchen to have a midday meal with my brother and sister, if they hadn’t had it yet.
 </p><p>Mother and Aunt Lyuda cooked separately for their families, and Grandma Katya ate the meals by her youngest daughter, together with her younger grandkids, Irochka and Valerik, at the common kitchen table by the wall between our and Duzenko’s parts of the <em>khutta.</em>
 </p><p>In the daytime, there was nothing on television but the frozen circle and squares for image adjusting with small knobs at the back of the TV box; if the circle was uneven then the announcers’ faces would be flattened or overly long. That’s why until the All-Union Television started to broadcast at five o’clock the TV was turned off and the midday meal was eaten under the muffled drum-roll-like chant from behind the wall to the Pillutikha’s, whose blather at times peaked up into piercing but indistinct shrieks.
 </p><p>Then I went to Club and, coming back, again saw Pillutikha, backlit by a distant bulb in the room; she never turned on the light in the kitchen where she stood up against the hateful wall. After all the four parents of our <em>khutta</em> returned from work, Pillutikha would add the volume to which the usual comment of Father was, “Ew! Again that Goebbels at her hurdy-gurdy!”
 </p><p>Once Uncle Tolik put a large teacup to the wall to hear what she was croaking about. I also pressed my ear to the cup bottom – the gabble got nearer and sounded already not from behind the wall but inside the white teacup, yet remained as thick as before.
 </p><p>Mother advised not to pay attention to the half-witted old woman, and Aunt Lyuda explained that Pillutikha was putting curses on all of us through the wall. She turned to that same wall and pronounced with perfect poise, “Be all of that back to your bosom!”
 </p><p>I don’t know whether Pillutikha was crazy indeed. She managed to live alone, after all.
 By the end of the war, her daughter left Konotop for the safety’s sake – not to have troubles for her cheerful behavior with the officers of the German Company Headquarters lodging in her parents’ <em>khutta.</em>
 Pillutikha’s son Grisha was doing his ten-year stretch in prison for some murder. Her husband died; no TV by her side. Maybe, she kept cursing so as not to go nuts, who knows…
 </p><p>Grandma Katya never commented or said anything about Pillutikha, she only smiled a guilty smile. On some days she moaned occasionally but not louder than the muffled Goebbels’ speeches from behind the wall…
 </p><p>And suddenly an ambulance arrived and she was taken to the hospital.
Three days later they brought Grandma Katya back and put on the leatherette-covered mattress-couch, constructed of the remains of the big sofa from the Object and placed under the window in the kitchen, opposite to the brick stove.
 </p><p>She did not recognize nor spoke to anyone, and only moaned loudly.
  In the evening our two families gathered in front of the TV and closed the door to the kitchen to cut off her moans and heavy smell. The Arkhipenkos moved their beds to the room and it became a bedroom for nine.
 </p><p>The next day the ambulance was called again, but they did not take her away and only made an injection. Grandma Katya quieted for a short time but then again began to swerve from side to side on her couch, repeating the same screams, “Oh, God! Ah, probby!”
 A few years later I guessed that “probby” was a shortened Ukrainian “forgive me, God”.
 </p><p>Grandma Katya was dying for three days.
 <br>Our families stayed at neighboring <em>khuttas</em>; the Arkhipenkos at Number 15, and we at 21, in the half of Ivan Kreepak.
 </p><p>Adult neighbors were giving our parents indistinct advice about breaking out the threshold to our <em>khutta</em>, or some of the floorboards inside it.
  The most common-sense proposal made Ivan Kreepak’s wife, auntie Tamara. She said that the couch with Grandma Katya stood under the window with a half-open leaf above her head, and the fresh air protracted the sufferings of the poor thing.
 </p><p>That same evening, Mother and Aunt Lyuda dropped into our <em>khutta</em> to grab more blankets, then they put out the light and got out onto the porch.
 There Aunt Lyuda neared the kitchen window and closed the leaf tightly. Then she stealthily stepped down to Mother and me—I was holding the blankets—with a smile of a naughty girl on her face, or so it seemed in the dark moonless night.
 </p><p>In the morning Mother woke us, sleeping on the floor in the living-room of Kreepak’s <em>khutta,</em> with the news that Grandma Katya died.
 </p><p>The funeral was the next day. I did not want to go, but Mother said I should.
 </p><p>I was burning with shame. It seemed to me that everyone knew that Grandma Katya was suffocated by her daughters. That’s why I let loose the ear-flaps of my rabbit-fur hat and pulled it over my eyes. And so I went all the way from our <em>khutta</em> to the cemetery, keeping my guilty head low, and looking at the feet of those who walked ahead of me.
 </p><p>It’s possible though that no one ever guessed that so I did  out of shame and not because of the strong wind slapping my face with icy pellets.
 </p><p>At the cemetery, under shrill cries of the three trumpets over the mound of snow mixed with black earth lumps, all Grandma Katya’s children were sobbing: both Mother, and Aunt Lyuda, and even Uncle Vadya.
