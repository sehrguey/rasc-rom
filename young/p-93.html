<img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">
 <p>The music at the wedding party was played by The Orpheuses, for free, sure thing, it was not a playing trash occasion.
 A couple of boards sealed Zhoolka up in his kennel so that in the circle of ground cleared of grass with the chain he dragged after him throughout all his dog's life, they'd put the instruments and the equipment.
 </p><p>Between the stack of crumbled bricks and the sectioned shed, there was set up a long table, parallel to both, in the shade of the two age-old American maples.
 </p><p>Olga and I sat with our backs to the fence of the Turkovs' yard. Two kitchen chairs under us were coupled into one seat by spreading over them the Father's turned inside-out  sheepskin coat with long wisps of fleece, not overly golden but black and maroon anyway.
 </p><p>Around the table there sat the Arkhipenkos, Uncle Vadya with his wife whose Adoptee he was, Olga's mother, Maria, who arrived from the Crimea with her eldest daughter, Vita, Aunt Nina and Uncle Kolya, some nondescript relatives of Solodovnikovs, the immediate and more distant neighbors from Nezhin Street, the Kreepaks, the Plaksins, the Kozhevnikovs, Vladya's mother Galina Petrovna, and all sorts of close friends either to the newly-weds or to the musicians, as well as flying parties of  the Settlement bros, always ready to drink for free...
 </p><p>The wedding party rambled on till late at night, under the light of a couple of bulbs fixed up in the maples.
 </p><p>They chanted "Bitter! Bitter!" for me and Olga to stand up and kiss each other while they would count loudly how long we kept the kiss.
 </p><p>Father, together with Olga's mother, was put into a handcart and shoot in it along the street (Maria was not quite happy with that ancient beautiful folk custom).
 </p><p>Quak bared himself to the waist and danced holding aloft the large ax which he grabbed from the lean-to, but Uncle Kolya started to clap in time as if he also was a rocker and, seizing a moment, took the ax from the merry Viking.
 The Settlement bros dragged Quak to his <em>khutta</em> because he was all mops and brooms already, while Skully kept copulating with Glushcha's sister in the most primeval posture, under the gloomy elm in the back garden.
</p><p>In short, quite a normal wedding it was, in style to the classic canons and traditions of the Settlement…
</p><p>Already after the midnight, Olga and I retired to our lean-to conjugal bedchamber...
 To commence the nuptials, I first had to tidy the place scraping Quak's vomit by the door with a shovel and sweeping out the cigarette butts left by Olga's girlfriends smocking in privacy.
 If I imagined beforehand that friendly openness might run into so a callous inconsideration I’d better hang a padlock on the door.
</p><p>Even the tape in the tape-recorder was obviously played, wound and rewound from the particular place with the erotic French song, which I was fixin' to switch on as the background for Consummation of Marriage.
 Hopeless to find it in a snap, I just switched the tape on from the very beginning—the song eventually would get played anyway—but as we finished the mentioned consummation it turned out that the tape reel was over too. I somehow missed enjoying those erotic grunts by Brigitte Bardot.
 </p><p>Then at the tin roof of the lean-to, a heavy shower clattered poring down on it and on the long leaves of corn crowding in its lot up to the glazed frame wide open into the night garden outside, and we just lay clasped in a tight embrace and it was good…
 </p><p>Our honeymoon coincided with my vacation from Plant.
 The first squabble happened on the third day of our married life.
 I was sitting in the yard deciphering sheet-music of some Spanish guitar piece. Olga walked past from the khutta to the lean-to and called me along.
 </p><p>I still picked strings for a minute or two, no more, before coming.
 She was on the bed shedding tears because I did not need her nor paid any attention: was that the right way to treat wives?
 </p><p>So I had to iron out my wrong-doing in the most effective, as far as I know, way, though I still couldn’t get it what was my guilt.
 </p><div id="span"><p>(...and only by now I have figured it out that so works the female instinct for self-preservation, "If you have already got me, then who do you keep practicing that fucking guitar for?"
 </p><p>However, quite possibly, that even now I don't understand them right...)
 </p></div><p>Lekha Kuzko brought the blissful news – we were to play dances at the KEMZ Plant Palace of Culture, he had arranged it.
 </p><p>I was delighted because there's no life without playing dances. Besides, when Olga and I were coming to dances at Loony and they kicked up a fight on the dance-floor there, I feared of accidental harm to her belly, although it was not noticeable yet.
 </p><p>The dances at KEMZ were attended by a crowd from neighborhoods too distant from Loony. Although The Spitzes played better music than we, yet long waiting for a streetcar after their dances would cure any melomania.
And even some bros from the Settlement began to show up at the KEMZ Palace of Culture. People like to join familiar crowds…
 </p><p>Vladya and Chuba were drafted into the army.
 Sur, a neighbor of Chuba's, who was still a tenth-grader, stepped into his shoes as the bass guitarist.
 </p><p>A guy from Zagrebelya, handled Fofik, started to sing with us. His crowning number was the song by Makarevitch.
 </p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"I drink to those who're at the sea now..."
 </p><p>And another one, about an American pilot, shot down in the sky over Vietnam.
 </p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"My F-4 as fast as a bullet..."
 </p><div id="span"><p>(...only recently I found out that was a Russian adaptation of the "Secret Service Man" of Mel Tormé which he sang back in the '50s.
 </p><p>In music, they always were ahead of us...)
 </p></div><p>One night Olga got with her kisses to my dick, and I yawped, "No need for a wafflister wife!"
 </p><p>She shrunk back, and I immediately regretted my idiocy. Moron! Why? It was so good!.
 Just joined the crowd of the stupid seminarians…
</p><p>When it became too cold in the lean-to, we moved into the <em>khutta</em>, on the couch in the kitchen.
  Each night, I tightly closed the double-leaf door between the kitchen and the room where slept my parents, and my brother and sister. Not because we were having sex every night, but so that they did not guess on what night we were at it…
 </p><p>At the dances in KEMZ Olga seldom danced, the belly became too big but the rock’n’rollers jumped around without ever heeding where to.
 And her light brown mini coat became too small for fastening any lower than by the two upper buttons.
 </p><p>Once she began to cry at night that I completely fell out of love with her. But that was not true, I felt sorry for her and wanted to protect from everything.
 </p><p>Olga cried and cried until she made me make love to her.
 And it was good, only I tried to be very careful so as not to hurt the belly in any way.
 Four days later Olga gave birth to my first daughter, Lenochka…
 </p><p>Children are the flowers of life until they wake up.
 </p><p class="centered2 bold ital">"All the day you cried and cried<br>
 With your mouth open wide,<br>
 No more crying by my side<br>
 Or I'll throw you outside!"
</p><p>Olga's small breasts turned out to be full of milk. After the feeding, she even had to milk  the excess off. And, of course, she didn’t get off my back until I agreed to try the product.
 Well, tastes differ and stuff, there’s no use to argue, but what the heck do them those silly babies find in it? Pasteurized milk is much better…
</p><p>Aunt Nina said that the child must be baptized and we took Lenochka to a <em>khutta</em> nearby School 12, at the address given by Olga's aunt.
 There were many people crowding in the yard. On the whole, it was a church though without the cross on its roof, sort of an underground temple. But inside it was a commonplace<em> khutta</em> only without a single piece of furniture.
</p><p>The baby was taken out of the envelope,  moistened hastily so as to set it in the mood for a protesting howl, and presented with a small cross on a string.
</p><p>I forgot even to think about the holy event, yet at the end of January Lyonya, the Manager of the Experimental Unit and also the Komsomol Head of the Repair Shop Floor called all the younger locksmiths up to the Management Office after work for a Komsomol meeting.
 </p><p>There he announced that he was informed by the City Komsomol Committee that I had been to church and baptized my child for which breach of Komsomol ethics the present meeting should pronounce a reprimand to me, as a renegade member.
 </p><p>Everyone voted "pro" at once to cut the meeting short and go home but, leaving hurriedly, expressed their condolence to me for not getting expelled from the organization completely, which would cancel another ten years of their keeping Komsomol contributions from my wages.
 </p><p>As I learned later, the priest baptizer each month was handing in the list of visitors to his crossless church-<em>khutta</em>. That's some underground clergyman for you… But then, so, probably, were their conditions for tolerating his activities at all.</p>
