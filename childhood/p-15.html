<br><h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Childhood<br>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The unexpressed desire for reinforcing my faltered authority and self-esteem, or maybe some other inexpressible, or already forgotten, reasons resulted in my getting nasty.
</p><p>One evening, with the light in the room already turned off, yet my brother-and-sister, laid to sleep with their heads on the opposite armrests in the huge leatherette sofa, still a-giggling and kicking each other under their common blanket because Grandma Martha couldn’t upbraid them while standing by her bed and whispering into the upper corner, I suddenly spoke up from my folding bed, “Tell you what, Grandma? God is a jerk!”
</p><p>After a moment of complete silence, she erupted with a stream of threats about my licking a red-hot frying pan in the future, yet I only laughed in answer and, encouraged by the reverent lull on the sofa, kept brazenly despising pending tortures, “Whatever! Your God’s a jerk all the same!”
</p><p>The following morning Grandma Martha did not talk to me.
</p><p>On my return from the kindergarten, Natasha shared that in the morning, as Dad came home after the night shift, Grandma told him everything and cried in the kitchen and that at the moment our parents were gone to a party at someone’s but I’d be let have it, and that’s that!
</p><p>To my goody-goody attempts at starting a dialogue, Grandma Martha kept stubbornly silent and soon went over to the kitchen.
</p><p>The front door slammed, the parents’ voices sounded in the hallway. They moved to the kitchen where the talk became quicker and hotter. The door of our room prevented making out the subject in the heated discussion.
</p><p>The voices' volume grew on steadily until the door flew open with Dad’s hand. “What? Scoffing at elders? I’ll show you ‘a jerk’!” His hands pulled the narrow black belt with a flashing rectangle of the buckle from the waist of his pants. His arm swayed and a never experienced pain scorched me.
 </p><p>Once more. And more.
</p><p>Wailing and wriggling, I rolled under Grandma’s bed to escape the belt.
</p><p>Dad grabbed the back of the bed and with one mighty jerk pulled it to the middle of the room. The mattress with everything else dropped down alongside the wall.
</p><p>I followed the bed for sheltering under the shield of its springy mesh.
Dad was pulling the bed back and forth whipping it on both sides, but I with inexplicable speed ran on all fours under the mesh jumping overhead, and mingled my howling and wailing, “Daddy! Dear! My! Don’t beat me! I won’t! Never again!” into his, “Snotty sod!”
</p><p>Mom and Grandma came running from the kitchen. Mom screamed, “Kolya! Don’t!” and stretched out her hand to catch the hissing impact of the belt. Grandma also kvetched loudly, and they took Dad out of the room.
</p><p>Crestfallen, sobbing, I rubbed the welts left by the belt  looking away from the younger who, petrified and silent, huddled in the back of the big sofa…
</p><p>In the Courtyard, we played Classlets.
</p><p>First, you need a chalk to draw a big rectangular on the concrete path and divide it into five pairs of squares, like, a two-column table of 5 rows. The second need is the <em>bitka </em>– a used shoe polish can, a kinda tiny tin disk filled with sand conveying your <em>bitka </em> the gravity of its enclosed mass.
</p><p>Standing at the bottom of the first column, you throw your <em>bitka</em> into a classlet-square then go after it hopping on one leg (one leap per square) to pick it up and proceed through the rest of the table, also in one-legged hops, to the bottom classlet in the second column and with the final leap leave the table of classlets altogether. A tour is done.
</p><p>(While traveling through the table, take care your sandal never lands near any of the chalked lines or else the other players, closely watching your progress, would raise a hell of jeering shouts insisting that you stomped on it.)
</p><p>Now, safely out of the Classlets table, you have the right to throw your<em> bitka</em> targeting the next square and repeat your hopping tour to carry it out.
</p><p>After your <em>bitka</em> visited, in turn, all of the classlets, you mark one of them as your “house” and further on in the game you may feel in it at home – put your other foot down and relax.
</p><p>Yet, if your<em> bitka</em> missed the proper square or landed on a line, or if you touched a line when hopping, another player starts their tries and you become a watcher…
</p><p>There were ball games as well.
 For example, hitting a ball non-stop against the ground, you had to accompany each strike with a separate word, “I! – know! – five! – girls’! – names!”
</p><p>At each subsequent hit at the ball, you called out one of five random names, no repetitions allowed.
Then followed five boy’s names, five flowers, five animals, etc., etc., until the ball bounced out of reach or the player got lost in their enumerations…
</p><p>Another ball game was not as intellectual.
 You just hit the ball against the  faded pinkish plaster on the house wall (closer to the corner, safely away from the window on the first floor). Guessing the landing spot of the re-bounced ball, you jumped over it with your legs wide apart before it hit the ground.
</p><p>The player behind you caught the ball to throw it back against the wall – this time for them to jump and you to catch. There could be more players in the game though, so you had to wait for your turn in the line of jumpers.
</p><p>I was enchanted by the game’s infinity. It was like those endless pictures on the red side of Fire Extinguisher…
</p><p>We played outside the Courtyard as well, across the ever-empty road surrounding the twin blocks.
</p><p>Atop the descend towards Recruit Depot Barracks, there was a tall plank-fence enclosure hoarding large garbage containers for all of our Block. Next to the fence there stretched a level area grown with green grass except for a lonely sagging pile of sand, probably, a leftover from the construction times and later used like any sand by any children in any sandbox.
</p><p>There was a special sand game though, which had no name.
</p><p>You just scooped a handful of sand and tossed it up, trying to catch the returning sand into your palm, as much as you could. The catch was held in the outstretched hand and you pronounced the ritual formula, “So much – for Lenin!”
</p><p>Then the sand in the palm was thrown up again and caught for the second time. Over the second catch, the words of the formula changed the addressee, “So much – for Stalin!”
</p><p>After the third toss, no one cared to catch the sand, on the contrary, they hid their hands behind their backs from the downing sand, and then even clapped to ensure not a grain of it got randomly stuck to the palm, “And so much – for Hitler! That’s that!”
</p><p>Somehow, I felt ill at ease about not fully fair play in the game when leaving the last in the trinity without a chance to get even the tiniest speck of sand. And one day playing at the pile alone, I broke the rules and caught a pinch of sand even for Hitler although I knew he was a very bad one…
</p><p>Besides, we used the sandpile’s sprawling outskirts for constructing of “secrets”—small holes scooped out no deeper than a teacup—whose bottoms we floored with the heads from the flowers picked in the grass. A shard of pane glass put upon the petals of the heads pressed them down and imparted a look of somewhat melancholic beauty.
</p><p>Then the hole was filled up and leveled and we made arrangements over it “to check our secret” the following day, but either we forgot about it or it rained, and later we could not find “the secret” and just produced another one…
</p><p>One day the rain caught me in one of the round gazebos in the Courtyard. As a matter of fact, it sooner was crossbred of the outright deluge with a thunderstorm.
</p><p>Black clouds piled up over the entire Courtyard, and all of it sunk in the dark as if wrapped with a dashing night.
The adults and children who happened to be in the gazebo scattered racing along the paths towards their houses. Only I tarried over a forgotten book with the pictures of three hunters roaming through the mountain woods until the waterfall rushed down from the darkness above.
 It was unthinkable to run home through that roaring flood, I had to only wait until it was over.
</p><p>Thunder pearls erupted madly, the lightning tore the sky over Block crisscross and hither-thither. The gazebo bounced from the deafening rumbling, and the wind-driven sheets of water lashed the inside circle of the cemented floor reaching far over its center.
</p><p>I placed the book on the bench running along the lee side props but some crazy drops got even there. It was so scary and wet, and cold, and never-ending.
</p><p>When, nonetheless, the storm let up, the clouds of darkness broke asunder revealing the blue of the sky as well as the fact that the day was far from being over yet, and that my sister Natasha was running from our staircase-entrance with the already needless umbrella because Mom sent her to call me home.
</p><p>“We knew that you were here”, she said panting, “You could be seen at first…”</p>
