 <img src="../../img/maht.png" style="float:right;width:123px">

<p>The first day in the service ended about midnight – we were trained to fit into forty-five seconds when going to sleep or getting up after it.
In the time specified, you had to remove all your outfit, carefully stack the items on a stool in the central aisle lit with the long daylight lamps under the ceiling, to dive into your bunk in the <em>koobrik,</em> and cover yourself with a sheet and blanket.
</p><p><em>Koobrik</em> was four two-tier bunk beds set in two rows closely, side by side,  separated from the neighboring <em>koobriks</em> by narrow passages where you collided with those who slept in the next <em>koobrik's</em> beds.
The collisions were just inevitable because the width of the inter-<em>koobrik</em> passage was dictated by the forty-centimeter-wide cabinet-box crammed in between the bunk beds bounding the passage with eight newbies rushing to their bunks.
Oops!. Ouch!.
</p><p>Under the top of the seventy-centimeter-tall cabinet-box, there was a drawer.
The door below the drawer provided access to the inside shelves. Those two shelves and the drawer were allotted to eight people whose bunk beds towered above the half-meter-wide four-meter-long passage.
 If any of the beds in the passage was occupied by a <em>grandpa,</em> then all of the cabinet-box, the drawer as well as both shelves under it, was his sovereign stowage whose indivisible immunity was not a matter for the feeblest discussion.
In case it was a <em>pheasant</em> but not a <em>grandpa</em>, he could farm out the lower shelf, still, not every <em>pheasant</em> would.
</p><p>Construction battalion trained you to live lightly and not  burden yourself with things you could do without.
As for your safety razor, it could find a place on the shelf of the buddies from your draft who happened to have neither oldies nor birds in the passage of their <em>koobrik...</em>
</p><p>Raising questions before commanding officers had undesirable backwash on the state of health.
The "pheasant-grandpa" system was the pledge of military discipline in the army, and an officer with disregard to it was sawing off a bough he sat upon. Therefore, in case of being addressed with some complaint, he complained about you to the "grandpas".
In the evening, the officer would go home after his day at the service, and at night the "grandpas" were damaging your state of health.
</p><p>Yet, all that was to be discovered later, and now the sergeants were walking along the central aisle of the training barrack, looking for a footcloth wound not accurately enough around its boot top, or a belt dropped in a hurry over the stool in a careless manner, or the absence of any part of outfit – the son of a bitch had dived under the blanket half-dressed!.
</p><p>Finding where to find fault, they commanded a general "get up!" and the training began anew.
No chance that we had started doing the job any better, most likely, the sergeants themselves wanted to sleep. After another "lights-out!" they did not command "get up!" and the long fluorescent tubes in the ceiling over the central aisle were switched off, except for the one over the cabinet-box at the entrance to the barrack.
Its remote light was not a hindrance, you could close your eyes and...
</p><p>"Get up!!"
</p><p>What? What for?! O, shit, it's morning! And where's the night?
</p><div id="span"><p>(...I have told already that time in the army is a dirty bitch, ain't I?.)
</p></div><p>A couple of "get up!" were conducted without much of nit-picking though, just to remind you're in the army now, bastards. Which leniency was caused by the breakfast ahead, and if we were late for it, the cook-<em>grandpa</em> would hail the sergeants with his <em>"J'ai presque dû attendre"</em> from the dispenser window.
</p><div id ="span"><p>(...the kings of France had a special courtier whose job was to clap his pole against the floor to bring attention to the monarch’s entry to this or that hall in one or another of the royal palaces.
The clap was coupled with the strident yell, "His Majesty the King!"
</p><p>So, one day at the Louvre, Louis of Certain Number, approaching the door to the general hall, noticed that the announcer was not in place.
Maybe, dropped around a corner to correct some kind of mess in his outfit...
</p><p>Yet, in the very last moment, directly from nowhere, the courtier with the pole ducked in the doorway and—as required by the statute—boomed his bang into the floor, "His Majesty the King!"
</p><p>In fact, the King hadn't even had to march on the spot, and passing by the servant, without much fuss, he reproached him in a royally dignified way:
</p><p><em>"J'ai presque dû attendre."</em>
</p><p>When translated from French, it means "I almost had to wait"...)
</p></div><p>But the <em>grandpa</em> in the window would translate it another way:
</p><p>"You, fucker! Got too fucking cocky, eh? They threw that sergeant stripe-snot across your shoulder-strap and you lost your scent? I fucking fuck your fucking rank and you too! You once again be late and I'll have you dispensing the fucking pots. You fucking cock!"
</p><p>And the sergeant would have nothing to parry such a translation with, because if though not a "cock", yet for the current period, he still was just a <em>pheasant.</em>
</p><div id="span"><p>(...What on earth could any king have to do with our construction battalion?
The most intimate connection.
The commonly used, albeit unofficial, denomination of the Soviet Army military construction battalions—aka conbats—was "the royal troops".
</p><p>Got that under your belt?
On we go.
</p><p>The outfit of the military conbat soldier, aka conbatist, consisted of a khaki piss-cutter with a small red-cherry star screwed in its bow with the still smaller yellow sickle-and-hammer inside.
 The star was a very important detail called to make easy seeing the front from the rear of the headgear.
</p><p>On the strength of its shape, the piss-cutter was of no use for protecting the soldier's ears.
 When caught in the strong wind or rain, you could turn off the cap's flaps and pull it on your skull, yet the trick bestowed on the serviceman the looks of a mugger in a "condom"-hat.
</p><p>Under certain circumstances, the conbatist could even put his piss-cutter crosswise, that is, with the star transferred into position above one or another of his ears.
</p><p>The cap applied in that manner was supposed to present a motif "a-la Tricorn of Bonaparte", however, on the whole, that looked like a dull moron with the star on the side of his fucking gibbosity.
</p><p>Alternately, the head of the conbat soldier might be covered with a forage cap, but, according to the Statute of Inner Service, the forage cap should be accompanied with the jacket and trousers over the blunt-nosed high shoes of black leather.
</p><p>Such a set was briefly referred to as "parade-crap" (ceremonial uniform) with black shoulder-straps on the shoulders of the jacket.
</p><p class="centered3 ital">(...black is always in vogue…)
</p><p>The black insignia fields up the lapels of the ceremonial outfit were decorated with miniature emblems of military construction troops, made of a light yellow alloy.
</p><p>The same emblem was repeated in a larger size on the forearm part of the jacket's left sleeve, but already without any metal impurities.
</p><p class="centered3">
<img src="../../img/shevron.gif" ></p><p>
<figure class=" ital"><p class="centered3 bold">The Brief Heraldic Explication of the Conbat Emblem<br>&nbsp;
</p><p class="centered2">“Battalion Commander pours forth <strong>Thunder-and-Lightning;</strong><br>
Ensign trots like a squirrel in the<strong> Wheel;</strong><br>
I dropped the<strong> Anchor </strong>and don't care a fuck, <br>
They won't urge me onward<br>
Not even with the fucking<strong> Bulldozer.</strong>”
</p><p class="centered3 ital">~ ~ ~
</p></figure><p>Between the parade-crap jacket lapels, peeped a khaki shirt and a necktie of a darker hue of khaki with the elastic string—like that in underpants—hidden under the collar and secretly holding the tie in place.</p>
