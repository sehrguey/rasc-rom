<h3><sub>~ ~ ~</sub> The Parade of Planets<br>&nbsp;</h3>


<p>The second interpenetration occurred in the building of the railway station, where I inquired a militiaman about the number of population in the city of Odessa. For an answer, he directed me to the police station on the first floor.
The on-duty lieutenant, to whom I repeated the question, told me to wait for a while.
</p><p>Obedient to his instruction, I leaned against the barrier separating us and watched as the red worms of his lips lustfully closed on, and squeezed, and twirled the filter of his unlit cigarette, under the accompaniment of heavy thuds and loud shrieks behind my back.
</p><p>With a fleeting glance in that direction, I registered a door opened to the next room, where a woman in a light headscarf and the black robe of a janitor aptly wielded the hefty handle of her mop to knock the crap out of a bozo draped in only his red underpants.
I didn't turn back any more until the execution was over because of never being attracted by scenes of violence, besides, under my trousers there was an exact clone of those red underpants though not in such a geriatric state.
</p><p>After getting the pleasure due to his rank and position, the lieutenant lit the cigarette, and said that a million was not reached yet, maybe, somewhere about six hundred thousand people…
</p><p>That's why, when on my next visit to the city and being late for the last bus to New Dophinovka, I preferred to spend the night in the greens inside the circular intersection in front of the railway station.
It turned out to be completely deserted because the underground passage to it was unlit.
</p><p>Having chosen the most distant from the lamppost bench, I lay down. The bench beams felt so hard that I recollected Edgar Poe killed on a bench in Baltimore, state of Maryland, for $40—a literary fee he had just collected—and partly pulled out the advance I received on that day in Pole Explorers Square, like a coquettish handkerchief made of three-ruble notes, for the purpose of self-training and development of my personal courage.
The traffic along the circular intersection had almost ceased, but the bench became even harder. However, I kept my eyes shut for the principle's sake because the night is for sleeping.
So I was not asleep when there came the tiny sounds of cautious steps over the rounded path.
</p><p>He walked up and for about a minute stood over me lying on the bench, with the Edgar Poe mustache, in a blue T-shirt and the Soviet three-ruble banknotes sticking out from the breast pocket on it.
Then he left keeping as quiet as he was when approaching. For the sake of principle and training, I did not open my eyes to see who it was.
</p><p>In the morning, I woke up on the same bench rather chilled and stiff as a board but, unlike the great American romantic, alive.
A flock of ravens flew croaking in the dawn sky, flapping their wings. Seemingly, the same ones that coasted above Nezhin heading north-east on the Day D. It did take them a long time to get over to Odessa.
A feather dropped from the wing of one in their squadron and, somersaulting in zigzags, kept falling down.
</p><p>The face upturned, I followed the jerky trajectory and walked to intercept it, not heeding the dug up beds with sickly flowers.
At the meeting point, I outstretched my palm towards the black dodger, caught it, and went back to the asphalted path.
There I dropped the catch tenderly into a trash bin saying, "Not while I'm around, please."
</p><div id="span"><p>(...a lesser-known German poet from the first half of the 20th century once cared to bemoan his own unworthiness, otherwise, he would not allow for the world's self-massacre.
</p><p>Few of the venerable laureates rise to so a deep comprehension of a poet's responsibility for the fate of the world.
Inertly cling they to the trivial standpoints and rituals of their time, yet if you think about it closely...)
</p></div><p>However, just to think is not enough, it's also necessary to think out, as Valentin Batrak, aka Lyalka, cared to say somewhere…
</p><p>On reaching the deadline for my return to take you and Eera over to Odessa, there, in fact, was no place to bring you to. However, with the word given, I had no choice but come back, and at least explain the reasons for the postponement of the move.
I had no money for the travel, neither anyone who I addressed for a loan. The urgent need brought about the idea to exchange the wedding ring for money at the pawnshop.
</p><p>While I found it in the city, it was already open with the line starting outside the front door...
The pawnshop was one long room with barriers along its three walls.
In the sheet glass partitions atop the barriers, there were small rounded windows one of which even had iron grating. It was to that very window, the farthest one, for all that crowd to queue. At the time when the pawnshop closed for the midday break, I was at some four meters from that window.
</p><p>In the breast pocket of my T-shirt, there was the ring that I hardly managed to rip off the finger the night before. Even the soap and water from the washstand nearby the hostel were of little help. Along with those self-inflicted tortures, I remembered the projectionist booth in the Plant Park and felt sorry for Olga.
</p><p>The pawnshop opened again and, after waiting in the line for one more hour, I apprehensively handed the ring in because the person before me failed – her earrings did not pass the check for genuine gold.
My ring proved acceptable though and I received 30 rubles, as well as the pawnshop's ticket…
</p><p>The following morning, I came to the New Bazaar and bought a blue plastic mesh-bag, and four kilos of apricots to fill it with, they were not fully ripe though.
Then I went to the booth with flowers and said that I needed three red roses.
</p><p>For the flower girl, it sounded like a clandestine password, and from some special place behind the counter she took out minikin, dark red, roses, exactly three, on  long sturdy stalks. "You meant these?"
</p><p>"Sure."
</p><p>From the New Bazaar, I went to the airport—not much better than the one in Stavropol—and stood in the line till the midday break.
When the ticket office window was closed, I remained standing nearby, like a statue with the three red roses in my hand, and only put the apricots on the floor under the window. Keeping four kilos for an hour seemed too much of a strain for my hand.
</p><p>After I bought the ticket, there remained four hours before the departure and I was already tired of life with my hands busy holding something.
I took the flowers and the fruits to the automatic storage cells, but I could not leave the roses inside because I felt sorry for them; they would surely welk in there with the air and light cut off.
</p><p>Looking around a small corridor, I found the janitors' room and asked for permission to leave the flowers and apricots there. They agreed and I went out into the city hands-free, but I did not venture too far off.
</p><p>At six I came after the roses.
The janitors were washing the floor in the corridor, and one of them told me I'd better wait. I insisted on getting them right away to be in time for the plane departing in half-hour.
</p><p>She grinned and, without further arguing, let me take the roses sticking out of one of their tin pails filled with water. The janitor only warned that they had treated themselves on the apricots a little bit.
</p><p>I went to a long shed on the edge of the take-off field and, together with other passengers having tickets for that flight, waited till midnight because each half-hour the loudspeakers announced a delay of the flight to Kiev. My delayed fellow-travelers also tried the apricots and approved.
</p><p>After midnight, in the crude glare of the arc lamps along the runway, two stewardesses were counting us on the stairs to have no more than 27 passengers because for the flight they had to substitute a smaller aircraft, AN-24.
</p><p>When onboard, it took some time to become warm after the chilly night breeze from the sea during that long wait.
Since then I keep from arguing with janitors…</p>
